My friends and I each enjoyed our plates as we ordered everything from the calamari to the chilaquiles and steak.  The short rib in the chilaquiles was super tender and flavorful and I could've eaten bowls of it the remainder of the day.The biggest issue we had while dining was simply the flies that were around due to a lot of the live plants from the environment of the restaurant.

You can tell the chef trying to be unique and trying to do things just a bit different.  The warmth and hospitality were wonderful.

The only thing that disappointed me was the pavlova.  One of my ultimate favorite desserts.  I loved  the effort to be unique. It was a deconstructed pavlova with ice cream.  It seemed to be more ice cream than anything and The fruit was very tart. So one bite was  super sweet and the next was so tart my mouth and face literally puckered.  The back patio was quaint and a fun find tucked in Hollywood.  The owner was super sweet making sure everything was ok, telling us to walk to pantages bc parking was cheaper.  This felt much more like a European cafe  where you asked for a check and you can sit and talk to friends all night.  Or even going over to his house for a bbq.  We weren't rushed in anyway.  Would recommend trying.","1620 N Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,1701,"Gastropubs, Latin American",$$,positive,1209,0.232,0.017,0.752,0.995,0.9977871655602495,0.5714285714285712,"['came', 'pantages', 'unique', 'find', 'tell', 'chef', 'trying', 'unique', 'trying', 'things', 'bit', 'different', 'warmth', 'hospitality', 'wonderful', 'ordered', 'variety', 'dishes', 'including', 'arugala', 'tostada', 'tasted', 'like', 'delicious', 'avocado', 'toast', 'corn', 'tostada', 'ok', 'potatoes', 'yummy', 'could', 'crispier', 'pork', 'belly', 'deliciously', 'charred', 'beet', 'quesadilla', 'wow', 'would', 'guessed', 'baked', 'brie', 'oh', 'crème', 'brûlée', 'good', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'pavlova', 'one', 'ultimate', 'favorite', 'desserts', 'loved', 'effort', 'unique', 'deconstructed', 'pavlova', 'ice', 'cream', 'seemed', 'ice', 'cream', 'anything', 'fruit', 'tart', 'one', 'bite', 'super', 'sweet', 'next', 'tart', 'mouth', 'face', 'literally', 'puckered', 'back', 'patio', 'quaint', 'fun', 'find', 'tucked', 'hollywood', 'owner', 'super', 'sweet', 'making', 'sure', 'everything', 'ok', 'telling', 'us', 'walk', 'pantages', 'bc', 'parking', 'cheaper', 'felt', 'much', 'like', 'european', 'cafe', 'asked', 'check', 'sit', 'talk', 'friends', 'night', 'even', 'going', 'house', 'bbq', 'rushed', 'anyway', 'would', 'recommend', 'trying']"

Just some faux leaf trellis panels attached to the wooden 1/2 walls that are throughout and maybe some big ceramic pots and some kind of creative hanging animal art descending from the ceiling.

Kimchi Fried rice was so tasty when you mix the two sunny side up eggs in.  Baguette with butter and jam brings back memories of Paris!Service was great.  They fill the water, check on you even though the restaurant was busy.Very relaxing atmosphere.  Beautiful place.  You order your food at the counter and prepay.  Then find a table and they will bring the food to your table.  There was a line but moving.  We waited in line for about 20 minutes.  Parking was a bit hard.  The area has some meter parking or free parking but very limited spaces.  Restaurant has valet parking but I didn't see the person.","624 S La Brea Ave Los Angeles, CA 90036",4.2,7038,"French, Breakfast & Brunch, Cocktail Bars",$$,positive,920,0.135,0.045,0.821,0.9348,0.9675115670891169,0.5,"['great', 'food', 'ordered', 'traditional', 'breakfast', 'maine', 'lobster', 'omelette', 'avocado', 'toast', 'kimchi', 'fried', 'rice', 'half', 'baguette', 'everything', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'huge', 'thick', 'cut', 'bacon', 'traditional', 'breakfast', 'lobster', 'omelette', 'luxurious', 'delicious', 'avocado', 'toast', 'pretty', 'cut', 'kimchi', 'fried', 'rice', 'tasty', 'mix', 'two', 'sunny', 'side', 'eggs', 'baguette', 'butter', 'jam', 'brings', 'back', 'memories', 'paris', 'service', 'great', 'fill', 'water', 'check', 'even', 'though', 'restaurant', 'relaxing', 'atmosphere', 'beautiful', 'place', 'order', 'food', 'counter', 'prepay', 'find', 'table', 'bring', 'food', 'table', 'line', 'moving', 'waited', 'line', 'minutes', 'parking', 'bit', 'hard', 'area', 'meter', 'parking', 'free', 'parking', 'limited', 'spaces', 'restaurant', 'valet', 'parking', 'see', 'person']"

You can't go wrong with their pastas, they are always incredible. But I tried their tuna sandwich for the first time last night and just.... Wow. Hands down the best tuna sandwich I've ever had, which is saying something since I was already a huge fan of the basic tuna sandwich. The egg, cucumbers, and dill dressing blend beautifully together and bring out the tuna's flavor perfectly. The bread is exactly what you'd want on it too, sliced + toasted with just the right amount of butter. You can tell the chef behind their recipe was out to make the best tuna sandwich and you can taste the love behind it. So worth the 16 bucks! (And it comes with a side)Never have had a bad drink here. Their wine is great, but I get tipsy from wine easily and I'm often the designated driver, so I usually go with their pear cider Stem (and it's so good).As for desserts, I've tried their tiramisu some time back and wasn't a fan. Might've just been a bad night cause it just was on the bland and dry side. But they've since added cannolis, which are very good! I love their affogato as well.Price wise, it's about typical as any date night place in LA. Pastas are around 20 dollars, with it costing more to add protein. Apps remain around 10-15 depending on what you get. But you are paying for quality and won't be disappointed.Parking can be tricky. I usually go to one of the public parking lots a couple blocks down 8th street that's a dollar an hour.

It's not overwhelmingly noisy, though. Now, onto the food - I tried the ""Tremendous Burger ($20)"" which, to be honest, tasted only slightly better than a McDonald's burger. It didn't come close to the tastiness of In-N-Out. The sweet potato fries were decent but nothing to write home about.I also ordered a coffee for $7, and it was a pretty basic shaken latte, nothing exciting. When it comes to service, be prepared to wait at least 10 minutes for someone to take your order, and make sure to tell them everything you need all at once because who knows when you'll see them again.All in all, I'd rate the food 5/10.

The ambiance and decor are really feminine and pretty, the ambiance is super approachable, and the food is fantastic (I personally love the pizzas)! It's hard to find vegetarian options that actually TASTE good, but Olivia somehow achieves this. They apparently get all of their produce from local farmer's markets, so you know that you are eating super high quality and fresh ingredients. And on top of all this, the staff is so wonderful.

16,2023-08-30,2023-09-17,Olivia,"Disclaimer: Before I get into more details about Olivia, a thing to note is this place does not have traditional waiters/waitresses taking your orders and instead utilizes an online ordering service where you can order at your own pace and charge within the same group/table. The system works like at the bar where you have an open tab and when you're done ordering, you can close it and pay directly through the phone. If you aren't as technologically savvy, the staff is friendly and accommodating too!I booked a reservation for my girlfriend and me for a cute little anniversary dinner on a Sunday and the vibes were on point from the get-go. Our waitress greeted and congratulated us on our anniversary. She was very thorough when it came to describing how to use the ordering system and any recommended dishes. All of the staff were very lively, accommodating, and really friendly to the point where I felt like I was revisiting some old friends again.For the food, we ordered fried olives, crispy chicken, mushroom pate, housemade focaccia, and mushroom soy sausage pizza.-Fried Olives is really good and what everyone says about it is true. I am not a person who enjoys olives but this was a positive flavor surprise. GET IT!- Crispy Chicken is fried mushrooms and the seasoning gives them a similar nostalgia to eating KFC popcorn fried chicken. I loved it, especially with the pickled onions on the side and the dipping sauce it came with.- The mushroom soy sausage pizza was great, especially with the vegan, melty cheese topped with arugula for a peppery finish. We initially weren't able to order pizza since the waitress notified us there were some complications with the dough, thus pizzas were not available to order via the online ordering system. However, the problem seemed to be resolved and the waitress told us that the pizza may look a bit smaller due to the dough, but still the same portion used daily.-Lastly, we were surprised at the end with a complimentary olive oil cake with a dark, cherry sauce and topped with vanilla ice cream. The cake was subtly sweet, not dry, and tasted bright combined with the cherry and ice cream.Overall, we came as guests and left as family members. Everyone there was so nice and attentive. There was especially one of the waitresses who also checked up on us multiple times at the end, got to know us through some small talk, and brought good vibes in an endearing auntie way. Not only that, the music was exactly my type of jam. I love this place for its ambiance, friendly staff, and for having the best vibes. I'll definitely be back soon whenever I'm in LA.","205 S Vermont Ave Los Angeles, CA 90004",4.9,173,"Vegetarian, Pizza, Wine Bars",$$,positive,2622,0.169,0.013,0.818,0.9975,0.9990444578555623,1.0,"['disclaimer', 'get', 'details', 'olivia', 'thing', 'note', 'place', 'traditional', 'taking', 'orders', 'instead', 'utilizes', 'online', 'ordering', 'service', 'order', 'pace', 'charge', 'within', 'system', 'works', 'like', 'bar', 'open', 'tab', 'done', 'ordering', 'close', 'pay', 'directly', 'phone', 'technologically', 'savvy', 'staff', 'friendly', 'accommodating', 'booked', 'reservation', 'girlfriend', 'cute', 'little', 'anniversary', 'dinner', 'sunday', 'vibes', 'point', 'waitress', 'greeted', 'congratulated', 'us', 'anniversary', 'thorough', 'came', 'describing', 'use', 'ordering', 'system', 'recommended', 'dishes', 'staff', 'lively', 'accommodating', 'really', 'friendly', 'point', 'felt', 'like', 'revisiting', 'old', 'friends', 'food', 'ordered', 'fried', 'olives', 'crispy', 'chicken', 'mushroom', 'pate', 'housemade', 'focaccia', 'mushroom', 'soy', 'sausage', 'olives', 'really', 'good', 'everyone', 'says', 'true', 'person', 'enjoys', 'olives', 'positive', 'flavor', 'surprise', 'get', 'crispy', 'chicken', 'fried', 'mushrooms', 'seasoning', 'gives', 'similar', 'nostalgia', 'eating', 'kfc', 'popcorn', 'fried', 'chicken', 'loved', 'especially', 'pickled', 'onions', 'side', 'dipping', 'sauce', 'came', 'mushroom', 'soy', 'sausage', 'pizza', 'great', 'especially', 'vegan', 'melty', 'cheese', 'topped', 'arugula', 'peppery', 'finish', 'initially', 'able', 'order', 'pizza', 'since', 'waitress', 'notified', 'us', 'complications', 'dough', 'thus', 'pizzas', 'available', 'order', 'via', 'online', 'ordering', 'system', 'however', 'problem', 'seemed', 'resolved', 'waitress', 'told', 'us', 'pizza', 'may', 'look', 'bit', 'smaller', 'due', 'dough', 'still', 'portion', 'used', 'surprised', 'end', 'complimentary', 'olive', 'oil', 'cake', 'dark', 'cherry', 'sauce', 'topped', 'vanilla', 'ice', 'cream', 'cake', 'subtly', 'sweet', 'dry', 'tasted', 'bright', 'combined', 'cherry', 'ice', 'came', 'guests', 'left', 'family', 'members', 'everyone', 'nice', 'attentive', 'especially', 'one', 'waitresses', 'also', 'checked', 'us', 'multiple', 'times', 'end', 'got', 'know', 'us', 'small', 'talk', 'brought', 'good', 'vibes', 'endearing', 'auntie', 'way', 'music', 'exactly', 'type', 'jam', 'love', 'place', 'ambiance', 'friendly', 'staff', 'best', 'vibes', 'definitely', 'back', 'soon', 'whenever', 'la']"

17,2023-08-14,2023-09-17,Osteria Mamma,"** First time trying Osteria Mamma **Wine menu is extensive and impressive!!We also made a reservation on a Saturday FOR Saturday.Parking was a breeze - found a spot right in front of the restaurant and so did our pals meeting us.Everyone is talking about the complementary bread... I feel like the idea of the complementary bread is wonderful but the bread itself isn't great. What is great is if your dining pal is ordering something with pink sauce... and then you can save the bread for the pink sauce but other than that, the bread is a big MEH and could totally step it up.Our waiter was from Italy - we thought this was wonderful! However... he interrupted my wife a few times and was actually kind of rude to her. Wasn't the coolest thing I experienced... he was attentive to our party but the rudeness was a little off-putting.The prices for the dish are very high considering the portions are on the smaller side. I had the salmon... it was cooked perfect but I felt like when I read the menu I was receiving something on the side vs just a tomato salad. For some reason, I interpreted this as a salmon with a tomato salad and a spinach salad. Turns out there were pieces of the spinach on top of the salmon - but it wasn't phrased as a sauce/or that it would be a salmon flavor addition.As I looked around, it seemed everyone's portion was small... which is fine (I suppose even more fine for fine dining) but for the prices, it just didn't seem worth it. I think my wife had like 20 small gnocchi's... my pal had 5 ravioli's and the lasagna was just TOO CHEESY.It was a bit warm inside the restaurant - and they have these lamps on the tables instead of lighting the restaurant with the restaurant's lighting. I feel like the lamps got in the way and some tables had cool lighting... some had warm lighting... it was an odd touch.Bathrooms need an update - the decor looks very out of place and there was a Christmas decoration. Why? No clue.I enjoyed the food - the tastes were delicious but for overall experience I am really a 3 star teetering a 4 star. We were all hungry after! And for a salmon for $38, I really didn't anticipate being hungry after but I am glad to have found a new restaurant... that is always the highlight.","5732 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.0,1916,"Italian, Wine Bars",$$,positive,2244,0.15,0.067,0.783,0.9885,0.9945182055924362,0.35714285714285704,"['first', 'time', 'trying', 'osteria', 'mamma', 'wine', 'menu', 'extensive', 'impressive', 'also', 'made', 'reservation', 'saturday', 'breeze', 'found', 'spot', 'right', 'front', 'restaurant', 'pals', 'meeting', 'talking', 'complementary', 'bread', 'feel', 'like', 'idea', 'complementary', 'bread', 'wonderful', 'bread', 'great', 'great', 'dining', 'pal', 'ordering', 'something', 'pink', 'sauce', 'save', 'bread', 'pink', 'sauce', 'bread', 'big', 'meh', 'could', 'totally', 'step', 'waiter', 'italy', 'thought', 'wonderful', 'however', 'interrupted', 'wife', 'times', 'actually', 'kind', 'rude', 'coolest', 'thing', 'experienced', 'attentive', 'party', 'rudeness', 'little', 'prices', 'dish', 'high', 'considering', 'portions', 'smaller', 'side', 'salmon', 'cooked', 'perfect', 'felt', 'like', 'read', 'menu', 'receiving', 'something', 'side', 'vs', 'tomato', 'salad', 'reason', 'interpreted', 'salmon', 'tomato', 'salad', 'spinach', 'salad', 'turns', 'pieces', 'spinach', 'top', 'salmon', 'phrased', 'would', 'salmon', 'flavor', 'looked', 'around', 'seemed', 'everyone', 'portion', 'small', 'fine', 'suppose', 'even', 'fine', 'fine', 'dining', 'prices', 'seem', 'worth', 'think', 'wife', 'like', 'small', 'gnocchi', 'pal', 'ravioli', 'lasagna', 'bit', 'warm', 'inside', 'restaurant', 'lamps', 'tables', 'instead', 'lighting', 'restaurant', 'restaurant', 'lighting', 'feel', 'like', 'lamps', 'got', 'way', 'tables', 'cool', 'lighting', 'warm', 'lighting', 'odd', 'need', 'update', 'decor', 'looks', 'place', 'christmas', 'decoration', 'enjoyed', 'food', 'tastes', 'delicious', 'overall', 'experience', 'really', 'star', 'teetering', 'star', 'hungry', 'salmon', 'really', 'anticipate', 'hungry', 'glad', 'found', 'new', 'restaurant', 'always', 'highlight']"
17,2023-08-14,2023-09-17,Osteria Mamma,"This is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Los Angeles. I have been dining here for 15 years now. The decor is simple and understated with generational photos of the family that run the restaurant. Ask your server to point out who is who and hear the history of this incredible, hard working family. Chances are the young ones in the photos have grown up and taken a role in the operation of this family gem.On to the food...The menu has grown over the years adding dishes that are a bit more contemporary while also keeping the original items too. For starters they recently added an Arancini dish loaded with saffron infused arborio rice and short rib. It is super crispy on the outside and beautifully decadent on the inside. The dish is accompanied by three incredible sauces to soak up. Additionally I have always loved their Frittura Mista and the Polipozzo to start with. The salads are beautiful and fresh and delicious.The Pasta is on another level here. All of these dishes will make you feel like the namesake Momma still prepares them herself, may she RIP. My favorite is the Tonnarelli alla Carbonara, the sauce is thick and creamy yet delicate and the guanciale is cooked to a crispness that just makes it pop in your mouth. Another favorite is the Bigolo all'Amatriciana, the pasta is thick and filled with a beautiful texture and the guanciale is mouth watering in the san marzano tomatoes it is cooked down with.For mains we have always enjoyed the Bisteconna and the Il Branza, both of which always come out perfectly cooked and leaving us wanting more, which is hard because these dishes are large and worth sharing.Now I am no wine aficionado, however the wine menu is incredible. They feature mainly Italian wines with a BOOK that gives the region the grapes were grown and define's each areas practices and tastes. It's a history lesson of wine really.

18,2023-09-10,2023-09-17,Beauty & Essex,"My husband and I had a reservation Saturday evening. We arrived at 5:45pm and we were seated at 6pm in the upstairs dining room to the right. We were the first party to be sat there. The ambiance was nice, darkly lit and romantic. Very LA fine dining vibe. More parties were seated in this dining room section and the noise definitely picked up, it was hard to hear yourself talk.Honestly, I was ready to give this restaurant 1 star and leave before ordering our food. We waited almost 25 minutes for someone to take our order. We watched 4 parties who came after us get their orders taken AND we watched them get their drinks and food delivered to their table. Not sure if they were under staffed tonight, but this was very frustrating since we had to make our showtime for the Pantages and I was worried if our food would come out in time. We made eye contact with two staff who would circle around the dining room, but they seemingly were just in charge of refilling water.My husband talked me down and finally, our waiter approached our table. My husband politely informed him that we have been waiting for a while to place our order and would have to leave soon to catch our show. Our waiter kindly apologized and he did do his best to remedy the situation.As soon as we put in our orders, I got up to use the bathroom and by the time I got back, all the food was already there on our table. They even gave us an extra complimentary dish of meatballs. This gesture and the swiftness of getting our food quickly to us was very much appreciated.We ordered:- Braised chicken meatballs 5/5: juicy, tender meat and strong flavor with creamy truffle sauce- Classic Thick Cut Filet 4.5/5: the steak on its own was very flavorful and came out perfectly medium rare, sauces were just okay- Baguette with garlic chive butter 3.75/5: bread was warm and soft with a crunchy crust; butter was creamy and easy to spread, but the taste kind of reminded me of AMC popcorn butter which isn't a bad thing- Mac and cheese with shrimp and lobster 2/5: Al dente pasta, saucy had a nice creamy consistency but there was absolutely no flavor to it; the only flavor came from the lobsterWe also ordered drinks. The Beauty Elixir was just okay, it tasted just like a glass of champagne but with a frothy consistency from the strawberry and cucumber pulp yet no hint of the fruits' flavor. My husband liked his drink though the Spicy Crush.Overall, I strongly give this restaurant 3 stars. The food borders between decent and good. I don't think it's worth its very expensive price point to warrant a second visit. Our server was kind and tried his best to make up for our situation. I just really wish the restaurant would have a better system of attending to guests once they are seated in the order they arrive.","1615 Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.2,1627,"Lounges, American (New)",$$$,positive,2793,0.168,0.041,0.791,0.9973,0.9989438744719372,0.5,"['husband', 'reservation', 'saturday', 'evening', 'arrived', 'seated', 'upstairs', 'dining', 'room', 'right', 'first', 'party', 'sat', 'ambiance', 'nice', 'darkly', 'lit', 'romantic', 'la', 'fine', 'dining', 'vibe', 'parties', 'seated', 'dining', 'room', 'section', 'noise', 'definitely', 'picked', 'hard', 'hear', 'ready', 'give', 'restaurant', 'star', 'leave', 'ordering', 'food', 'waited', 'almost', 'minutes', 'someone', 'take', 'order', 'watched', 'parties', 'came', 'us', 'get', 'orders', 'taken', 'watched', 'get', 'drinks', 'food', 'delivered', 'table', 'sure', 'staffed', 'tonight', 'frustrating', 'since', 'make', 'showtime', 'pantages', 'worried', 'food', 'would', 'come', 'time', 'made', 'eye', 'contact', 'two', 'staff', 'would', 'circle', 'around', 'dining', 'room', 'seemingly', 'charge', 'refilling', 'husband', 'talked', 'finally', 'waiter', 'approached', 'table', 'husband', 'politely', 'informed', 'waiting', 'place', 'order', 'would', 'leave', 'soon', 'catch', 'show', 'waiter', 'kindly', 'apologized', 'best', 'remedy', 'soon', 'put', 'orders', 'got', 'use', 'bathroom', 'time', 'got', 'back', 'food', 'already', 'table', 'even', 'gave', 'us', 'extra', 'complimentary', 'dish', 'meatballs', 'gesture', 'swiftness', 'getting', 'food', 'quickly', 'us', 'much', 'ordered', 'braised', 'chicken', 'meatballs', 'juicy', 'tender', 'meat', 'strong', 'flavor', 'creamy', 'truffle', 'classic', 'thick', 'cut', 'filet', 'steak', 'flavorful', 'came', 'perfectly', 'medium', 'rare', 'sauces', 'baguette', 'garlic', 'chive', 'butter', 'bread', 'warm', 'soft', 'crunchy', 'crust', 'butter', 'creamy', 'easy', 'spread', 'taste', 'kind', 'reminded', 'amc', 'popcorn', 'butter', 'bad', 'mac', 'cheese', 'shrimp', 'lobster', 'al', 'dente', 'pasta', 'saucy', 'nice', 'creamy', 'consistency', 'absolutely', 'flavor', 'flavor', 'came', 'lobsterwe', 'also', 'ordered', 'drinks', 'beauty', 'elixir', 'okay', 'tasted', 'like', 'glass', 'champagne', 'frothy', 'consistency', 'strawberry', 'cucumber', 'pulp', 'yet', 'hint', 'fruits', 'flavor', 'husband', 'liked', 'drink', 'though', 'spicy', 'strongly', 'give', 'restaurant', 'stars', 'food', 'borders', 'decent', 'good', 'think', 'worth', 'expensive', 'price', 'point', 'warrant', 'second', 'visit', 'server', 'kind', 'tried', 'best', 'make', 'situation', 'really', 'wish', 'restaurant', 'would', 'better', 'system', 'attending', 'guests', 'seated', 'order', 'arrive']"

For food we decided on fresh oysters, Thai shrimp, Branzino, filet mignon and broccolini. The food tasted fantastic and so flavorful. The portions were on the bigger side. We loved the dessert wheel in the end and it was fun to try them all. Our drinks were very well made and tasty too. We really enjoyed our dinner with jazz music in the background.

His hospitality alone is an 11/10. We ended up ordering a beef plate and a shrimp plate. We were also given a SPAM musubi and our drinks on the house as it was our first time! It wasn't busy when we came in the late afternoon so we waited roughly 10 minutes for our food. When our food got called out and we unpacked it at our table, we were speechless it all looked so amazing. Not only did it look amazing, it tasted so incredibly wonderful. The shrimp on my palate were nearly as big as my fist and were bursting with flavor. The beef on my partners plate was so tender and flavorful as well! Also, the greens come so well seasoned and the purple rice is perfectly cooked! I would certainly re-order both plates! The complimentary SPAM musubi was also so grand; I will definitely add it to my next order! Overall, if you are in the DTLA area, I highly recommend Broken Mouth.

The glaze on the wings was delicious, and the chicken was fried to perfection. The pasta had a unique flavor and was tasty. The stir fried pork belly was solid.

32,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Pixiu Mala Hongtang,"I don't like leaving negative reviews on Yelp, and I don't usually engage in that. As a business owner myself, I understand the impact a casually written review can have, and I'm cautious about writing reviews. Especially in these tough economic times due to COVID-19, I want to support local businesses even more. However, I felt the need to leave a review today.In conclusion, I went alone and ended up paying $50 just for a bowl without a tip. At this price point, I could have gone to a place like M Grill and been much more satisfied. Here, it's a buffet-style system where you serve yourself and the food is cooked and brought to your table. The price is determined by weight, but why don't they tell you the price upfront? Why make you calculate it after you've already eaten? Their intentions were clear, and it left a bad taste in my mouth.To get to the point, I filled a very large plate with a little bit of everything. Since it was my first time here and my first time trying these foods, I asked the server if the amount I had was okay for one person. Her response was, ""Oh, it looks like you're very hungry, hoho."" My intention was simply to ask if I had taken too much for one person, not for some strange and irrelevant comment like that. But she insisted it was fine even though it was quite a lot.In the end, I filled two to-go boxes to the brim and took them home. So, I basically prepared three servings for myself. Why don't they tell you the price by weight upfront, so that the staff knows that what you're serving is too much for one person, especially for a first-time customer?The intention is very clear at this part. And why don't they ask if it's your first time? I had no idea if it was a self-serve system, and I sat there for over 10 minutes without getting any water or a menu. Later on, they realized I was a first-time customer and thought I was choosing my food from the menu. I mean, sitting alone for over 10 minutes as a first-time customer is pretty obvious, isn't it? Also, shouldn't there be at least two staff members working? One person handling cash, one in the kitchen, and one in the dining area, all while making me wait for over 10 minutes... Well, it was truly the worst dining experience I've ever had. I really, genuinely feel like I was scammed. Please don't run your business like this.And these kinds of reviews shouldn't make you feel bad; on the contrary, you should be grateful.

Those go by weight so be mindful of how much you're adding. Towards the end, there are skewers but beware, you pay per skewer. When you take your bowl to the counter, they'll ask if you want to add any meat. They'll add that when they're cooking your soup so it's a fixed amount. You can get anywhere from 0 to 4 spice.

Located next to The Garland Hotel, The Front Yard is an aesthetic restaurant that serves contemporary American dishes. The outdoor seating is very beautiful and there is enough shade to keep everyone cool during these hot summers.I normally don't order fried chicken sandwiches but for whatever reason, I had to get one today. The chicken was cooked properly, not too dry or undercooked (god forbid) and it wasn't overly battered. Honestly, the sandwich was good, nothing that Wow'd me, but also wasn't bad. It's exactly what I wanted and for the right price. The fries that came with it were also good, just standard good fries. I wish I could explain more, but it was just what you would expect, no crazy ingredients, no fancy fusions, just a good fried chicken sandwich that left me feeling satisfied.The wait-staff was incredibly accommodating and even wore a mask for us when serving and taking our order.

We wanted to go somewhere in downtown LA with a nice ambiance, great food and drinks. This place fell no short of that!We had James as our server and he was AMAZING. He came out of the gates very knowledgeable of the drink menu and recommendations for each of us. All of the cocktails we ordered had a WOW element, either dry ice, smoke, or fire was involved. I had the campania ($19) and the Sardinia ($21) which were both light and refreshing.We started with a few appetizers (2) braised meatballs ($20 each) and a truffle pizza ($38). The meatballs were so tender and had the most addicting sauce. The pizza was loaded with truffle and the Parmesan cream sauce was the perfect pair. HIGHLY recommend both of those apps.For our entrees, we had the hardest time deciding but James ensured everything on the menu was amazing. My friend and I had the bone marrow pasta ($32 each) which stole the show!! This was my favorite dish! In our group, they ordered the lobster pasta ($75) cacio y Pepe with truffle ($32+ Truffle price), Bolognese ($32) and Wagyu Alla Vodka Pizza ($28).We were so stuffed from the food and drinks and wanted dessert but there was no way we could do it. We decided to take pictures after in the hotel courtyard and it was the perfect aesthetic. Our experience overall was a great start to our vacation.

I really thought I chipped my tooth!  I told the waiter about it and he told me it was probably a peppercorn until I dropped it on the plate and he also realized it was in fact a pebble. He took the pizza away and told me he'd get me a new one. His reasoning was because of the arugula. After another 15 minutes the pizza came back with more unwashed arugula.  I feel like they could have handled it better.

49,2023-06-18,2023-09-17,Supremo,"Ive been to Supremo several times since it opened as I live in the area. The best things there are the pastas. However, I've noticed it's not always consistent. 2 months ago I had the Alfredo for the first time and it was incredible. I had it again last week and it was bland. The pizza doesn't have enough flavor and never seems quite right. Tonight I went and shared the caprese and the calamari. The caprese was made with ricotta although the menu says burrata. I would have told our server but they never came back to check us on. Ricotta just doesn't taste the same in that salad and wasn't what we were anticipating as described on the menu. The calamari had a tasty breading and dipping marinara. However the calamari itself was dried out, likely frozen. I also ordered a glass of wine which on the way out I saw came from a Gallo magnum bottle. The glass was $14. Everywhere online that same entire bottle of Cabernet sells for under $10. There used to be a super nice, helpful youngish Latino guy working there but I haven't seen him in awhile. He seemed like he cared about things and customers but I haven't gotten that vibe from anyone there since he's been gone.

Just beware, the restaurant itself is quite small (so that's why the wait could take awhile or more people order takeout).Since this was our first time here, we wanted to try their popular dishes. We ordered: stir fry cabbage, beef roll, dan dan noodles, mapo tofu, three-cup jidori chicken, pan fried pork buns. I think my favorite dishes were the dan dan noodles, beef roll, and mapo tofu. The mapo tofu was not spicy as other mapo tofu, but you can add chili oil on the side if you want it spicier.

It's missing flavor, the food was bland and not made with love and dedication. Beef noodle soup comes with hours of prep and hours of simmering so the beef is falling off the bone. Instead, it tasted like beef stock with a little bits of beef shank. Dan Dan noodles is suppose to be spicy, nutty and fermented. But It just tasted like diluted peanut butter.

The fresh noodles are always so satisfyingly chewy and the miso carbonara sauce is creamy and savory. Tastes even better with a generous sprinkle of togarashi (the red pepper stuff). Italians would probably shudder at the thought of this dish, but sorry Italy it's so very good! I would say if you come here you should stick to their specialty udons over the traditional cause they just have a little more something to them.I also always order my udon with a tempura soft boiled egg (a must!) and whatever other tempura I'm in the mood for. The pumpkin and kakiage are also great choices! The tempura always comes out hot and perfectly fried.During lunch they also offer a special combo of a mini rice bowl with your udon.

55,2015-01-28,2023-09-17,Marugame Monzo,"Wow, the best udon I've had! Excellent, excellent texture. Made in-house, and it has just the right amount of give. I also liked the cold options, and their signature ones are good for those who want something a little more fusion. Plus the servings are huge - everything comes out in giant bowls!THE WAIT: About a 20-minute wait for four of us at noon on a Saturday.THE SERVICE: Really professional and thorough. The guy who took our order really wanted to get it right, he repeated it back to us to check three times!SIGNATURE UDON* Miso Carbonara (Creamy White Sauce based Udon w/ Bacon, hint of Miso flavor. $12.50) - 3.5 starspic:yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…An interesting mix of western flavors and eastern textures. Definitely a very thick sauce, very heavy, just like you'd expect from a carbonara sauce at an Italian restaurant, and it went surprisingly well with the thick udon noodle thought I couldn't taste the ""hint of Miso flavor'. The thick bits of bacon were great. If you want something more familiar to a western palate or really different for Asian food, this is the way to go, but I wouldn't get this if you're looking for authentic Japanese cuisine.COLD UDON* Bukkake Udon (Cold Udon with Cold Broth. $6.95) - 4.5 starspic:yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…This was great! I was intrigued by the cold udon section, something I'd never had before. The photos made this serving look really small, but it still comes out in a huge bowl. You have to mix the different toppings (radish, bonito flakes, scallion, and tempura pieces) really well together. Once they're all in their right proportions mixed in, then it really tastes right! The radish adds a thickness, the tempura this great crunch, and scallion/bonita extra flavor. You can pour the sauce, in a separate container, over the noodle, but that ends up sinking at the bottom. I found it was better to make your spoon with the noodle and mixed toppings (get some from the bottom; they've invariably clumped there), then pour the sauce over your spoonful. Delicious!I also tried a bit of the Beef Udon (Hot Udon section), which was very classic and tasty. The meat was sliced very thin and was tender. It would've been my next choice had I not wanted a cold udon!yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…Menu:yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…","329 E 1st St Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.4,4567,"Japanese, Noodles, Asian Fusion",$$,positive,2282,0.13,0.0,0.87,0.9921,0.9963287064976867,0.6428571428571429,"['wow', 'best', 'udon', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'texture', 'made', 'right', 'amount', 'give', 'also', 'liked', 'cold', 'options', 'signature', 'ones', 'good', 'want', 'something', 'little', 'fusion', 'plus', 'servings', 'huge', 'everything', 'comes', 'giant', 'bowls', 'wait', 'wait', 'four', 'us', 'noon', 'service', 'really', 'professional', 'thorough', 'guy', 'took', 'order', 'really', 'wanted', 'get', 'right', 'repeated', 'back', 'us', 'check', 'three', 'times', 'signature', 'udon', 'miso', 'carbonara', 'creamy', 'white', 'sauce', 'based', 'udon', 'bacon', 'hint', 'miso', 'flavor', 'starspic', 'interesting', 'mix', 'western', 'flavors', 'eastern', 'textures', 'definitely', 'thick', 'sauce', 'heavy', 'like', 'expect', 'carbonara', 'sauce', 'italian', 'restaurant', 'went', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'thick', 'udon', 'noodle', 'thought', 'could', 'taste', 'hint', 'miso', 'flavor', 'thick', 'bits', 'bacon', 'great', 'want', 'something', 'familiar', 'western', 'palate', 'really', 'different', 'asian', 'food', 'way', 'go', 'would', 'get', 'looking', 'authentic', 'japanese', 'udon', 'bukkake', 'udon', 'cold', 'udon', 'cold', 'broth', 'starspic', 'great', 'intrigued', 'cold', 'udon', 'section', 'something', 'never', 'photos', 'made', 'serving', 'look', 'really', 'small', 'still', 'comes', 'huge', 'bowl', 'mix', 'different', 'toppings', 'radish', 'bonito', 'flakes', 'scallion', 'tempura', 'pieces', 'really', 'well', 'together', 'right', 'proportions', 'mixed', 'really', 'tastes', 'right', 'radish', 'adds', 'thickness', 'tempura', 'great', 'crunch', 'extra', 'flavor', 'pour', 'sauce', 'separate', 'container', 'noodle', 'ends', 'sinking', 'bottom', 'found', 'better', 'make', 'spoon', 'noodle', 'mixed', 'toppings', 'get', 'bottom', 'invariably', 'clumped', 'pour', 'sauce', 'spoonful', 'delicious', 'also', 'tried', 'bit', 'beef', 'udon', 'hot', 'udon', 'section', 'classic', 'tasty', 'meat', 'sliced', 'thin', 'tender', 'would', 'next', 'choice', 'wanted', 'cold', 'udon']"

It feels like they added more tables or maybe I don't remember because  it's been a while since I've been here.I usually go for the sea urchin udon, miso carbonara, or butter mentaiko squid udon but I've decided to try something different since it was hot and humid that day.I got the beef bukkake cold udon + $3 for double portion this time and I wasn't really a huge fan of the broth. The noodles, meat, and shredded daikon were excellent. The noodles still had that fresh al dente bite to them(nice and chewy), the beef belly wasn't too fatty, and the grated daikon gave it refreshing depth of flavor taste.Their fried chicken has always been on point crispy, tender, seasoned well and it pairs so well with the Japanese mayo/curry seasoning on the side.If you come here you have to definitely get sea urchin udon, miso carbonara, butter mentaiko squid, beef udon, and I would definitely try the curry next time.

Place is pretty small so I don't recommend for bigger parties. After we left around 7:45 there were a lot of people waiting so def recommend coming before 7.Ordered the mentai cream udon and miso carbonara udon with both being $16.75. Also got the fried chicken which was around $9. Both udon dishes were very tasty, especially the carbonara as the sauce was thick and the bacon flavor really came through. The mentai one had tons of mini scallops and a couple mini shrimp pieces which were nice and soft. However, both are a bit on the smaller side but would rate them a 7.7/10. The fried chicken was nice and crispy with a great umami flavor paired with curry power and Japanese mayo on the side (8/10).Biggest downside was that it did take a while to get our food (about 30 mins for udon) especially the fried chicken which took about 40 mins. It was a bit strange since it was an appetizer and it came when we just about finished our udon.

The lot is a little narrow, and there weren't too many available spots left. My party of 2 was able to be sat right away, but I've heard that there sometimes is a long line.Food/Drinks: I always like trying places that have a specialty dish, and this place's was seolleongtang: a hearty bone broth made from ox bones. They give you a HUGE bucket of green onions, and there are also accompanying rice, kimchi, and radish kimchi. This is the best seolleongtang you can get in LA. Nice simple broth with a great selection of meat topping options so you can get whatever you're feeling that day. Add salt to your preference, and you are bound to have a perfect meal on a cold gloomy day.Ambiance: The place was a very mom-and-pop shop. Nothing fancy, but clean and comforting.Service: The waitresses were very nice and quick. Order came out fast since it's basically the only thing on their menu (just with varying toppings).Take-Out Packaging: Styrofoam bowls and plastic bagsSummary: Simply put, if I'm craving seolleongtang, I'm making my way here. My only complaint is the price. I can't quite remember exactly how much it was, but it was almost $20 (plus a potential parking fee). While this dish is a classic, I feel a little hesitant dishing out that much for this dish. Yes, this place has the best seolleongtang, but is a bowl of seolleongtang worth $20? Maybe.

So if that's the ambiance you are looking for, this is not it.I ordered the tongue and flank. Added lots of green onion and salt to my preference. It was delicious.

59,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Perch,"Perch is an LA staple: The type of place that is consistently cited as a destination for tourists, the glitter-on-cheek crowd, Instagram influencers, those trying to land the gig, and those who want to experience the promise of Perch and determine for themselves if Perch merits its august reputation. I fall into the last category, and I can say that Perch fulfills its promise, kind-of, but not really, but at the same time it kind of does, if that makes sense. Like imagine that you have been wanting to taste this cookie and finally you do, and the cookie is everything you hoped it would be but not in the way you expected it to be. So you build up expectations in your head, that the reality of the situation does not deliver. I guess that is the problem with having a robust and notable reputation, you could never live up to it because you can never measure up to a person's imagination.My partner in dine was my friend Carlos, the epitome of a Peter Pan type, old enough to know better, but stubborn enough to remain young at heart. He credits his youthful charm, perspective, and look to his regular visits to the gym and eating right. Note that he did not order the fruit plate of Perch, which means that he is not too strict.I opt for valet. It cost 16.00 dollars. If it it seems high, it is not for downtown LA prices. When we got close, the Valet asked if I could park a car in a nearby spot. I sternly, said no, ""you can park it."" I did feel a certain type of way for being asked to park my own car, even if the spot was close. I go out to be pampered, to be a princess in the world of dining, and quite frankly, a princess does not park her own carriage. Carlos made a joke to the Valet, on how I needed my car parked because I did not know how to park that well. I was annoyed. I stood up for myself, and for that I was the butt of a joke. I paid 16 dollars, I did not want to park my car. Am I right reader? or Am I wrong? Truthfully there is no right or wrong answer. I told Carlos how I felt and it took a cocktail from Perch to my mellow my nerves.The cocktails were not only effective, but tasty. I am someone who does not like to taste alcohol. I informed our server of this fact. I cannot remember their name but they read female to me, so I will be using she/her pronouns to refer to them. I asked our server what recommendation she had for a super sweet drink, she suggested a drink, I cannot remember what it was called but it was pink- fruity for sure, and it had a rim of brown sugar, maybe. It went down sweet-- just like I like my cocktails. This was the cocktail that softened my nerves enough to forget Carlo's blunder of joking with the valet at my expense.Carlos and I started off with the avocado toast. It was solid. I especially appreciated the citrus taste afloat the avocado toast. I also appreciated that the toast was sliced into three slices. I hate when I have to wrestle with my avocado toast; either while cutting it, or when picking it up. I also appreciated that Carlos did not wrestle me when I had two of the slices, and he only 1. Still that did not atone for his faux pa.The rest of the food was simply solid. I had the burger, and the potatoes. He had the classic breakfast: Two eggs, chic ken sausage, and potatoes. He cleaned his plate, he left a small bite of the sausage. I had that small piece before it was taken away by the server. Glad I did--- it was really good sausage!There was a bus-person, she read female to me. She preferred to speak Spanish to me. She had a necklace that was half a heart and half an infinity sign. I asked her, who gave her the lovely gift. She replied her husband with a smile that my heart saw. We shared a moment. She felt it too.As she was cleaning tables, our eyes met and she returned a sincere smile. When I left the joint to go to the Perch Bar, she said in Spanish, thank you for coming, in the most sincere way, like a mother's kiss on her child's cheek- pure love. This is the type of service I expect, customer-centered, sincere, and like I was welcomed guest. Now you see, why I ddid not park my car myself, because that made me feel like I was a number to be processed, and I needed to help in the processing progress of my own turn around the revolving door.Of course, Perch is nestled in the heart of LA. You sit amidst LA's famous skyline. That is why for those who want pictures, go here. Our dining neighbors did. It was two women and one got up three times to take pictures of her partner in dine. Then the server tried her hand at the picture taking. The women did not come together for the server. The same woman who was photographed by her partner in dine, was now being photographed by the server. So, I get that good pictures are important for people, so if pictures are that important for you, come here. But I guess everyone needs to go to Perch to experience its promise and decide for yourself if it was fulfilled or not. Its lofty reputation demands it!","448 S Hill St Los Angeles, CA 90013",4.1,10020,"Lounges, French, Breakfast & Brunch",$$$,positive,4971,0.164,0.052,0.783,0.9989,0.9997485415409375,0.4285714285714282,"['perch', 'la', 'staple', 'type', 'place', 'consistently', 'cited', 'destination', 'tourists', 'crowd', 'instagram', 'influencers', 'trying', 'land', 'gig', 'want', 'experience', 'promise', 'perch', 'determine', 'perch', 'merits', 'august', 'reputation', 'fall', 'last', 'category', 'say', 'perch', 'fulfills', 'promise', 'really', 'time', 'kind', 'makes', 'sense', 'like', 'imagine', 'wanting', 'taste', 'cookie', 'finally', 'cookie', 'everything', 'hoped', 'would', 'way', 'expected', 'build', 'expectations', 'head', 'reality', 'situation', 'deliver', 'guess', 'problem', 'robust', 'notable', 'reputation', 'could', 'never', 'live', 'never', 'measure', 'person', 'partner', 'dine', 'friend', 'carlos', 'epitome', 'peter', 'pan', 'type', 'old', 'enough', 'know', 'better', 'stubborn', 'enough', 'remain', 'young', 'heart', 'credits', 'youthful', 'charm', 'perspective', 'look', 'regular', 'visits', 'gym', 'eating', 'right', 'note', 'order', 'fruit', 'plate', 'perch', 'means', 'opt', 'valet', 'cost', 'dollars', 'seems', 'high', 'downtown', 'la', 'prices', 'got', 'close', 'valet', 'asked', 'could', 'park', 'car', 'nearby', 'spot', 'sternly', 'said', 'park', 'feel', 'certain', 'type', 'way', 'asked', 'park', 'car', 'even', 'spot', 'close', 'go', 'pampered', 'princess', 'world', 'dining', 'quite', 'frankly', 'princess', 'park', 'carriage', 'carlos', 'made', 'joke', 'valet', 'needed', 'car', 'parked', 'know', 'park', 'well', 'annoyed', 'stood', 'butt', 'joke', 'paid', 'dollars', 'want', 'park', 'car', 'right', 'reader', 'wrong', 'truthfully', 'right', 'wrong', 'answer', 'told', 'carlos', 'felt', 'took', 'cocktail', 'perch', 'mellow', 'cocktails', 'effective', 'tasty', 'someone', 'like', 'taste', 'alcohol', 'informed', 'server', 'fact', 'remember', 'name', 'read', 'female', 'using', 'pronouns', 'refer', 'asked', 'server', 'recommendation', 'super', 'sweet', 'drink', 'suggested', 'drink', 'remember', 'called', 'fruity', 'sure', 'rim', 'brown', 'sugar', 'maybe', 'went', 'sweet', 'like', 'like', 'cocktails', 'cocktail', 'softened', 'nerves', 'enough', 'forget', 'carlo', 'blunder', 'joking', 'valet', 'started', 'avocado', 'toast', 'solid', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'citrus', 'taste', 'afloat', 'avocado', 'toast', 'also', 'appreciated', 'toast', 'sliced', 'three', 'slices', 'hate', 'wrestle', 'avocado', 'toast', 'either', 'cutting', 'picking', 'also', 'appreciated', 'carlos', 'wrestle', 'two', 'slices', 'still', 'atone', 'faux', 'rest', 'food', 'simply', 'solid', 'burger', 'potatoes', 'classic', 'breakfast', 'two', 'eggs', 'chic', 'ken', 'sausage', 'potatoes', 'cleaned', 'plate', 'left', 'small', 'bite', 'sausage', 'small', 'piece', 'taken', 'away', 'server', 'glad', 'really', 'good', 'sausage', 'read', 'female', 'preferred', 'speak', 'spanish', 'necklace', 'half', 'heart', 'half', 'infinity', 'sign', 'asked', 'gave', 'lovely', 'gift', 'replied', 'husband', 'smile', 'heart', 'saw', 'shared', 'moment', 'felt', 'cleaning', 'tables', 'eyes', 'met', 'returned', 'sincere', 'smile', 'left', 'joint', 'go', 'perch', 'bar', 'said', 'spanish', 'thank', 'coming', 'sincere', 'way', 'like', 'mother', 'kiss', 'child', 'pure', 'love', 'type', 'service', 'expect', 'sincere', 'like', 'welcomed', 'guest', 'see', 'ddid', 'park', 'car', 'made', 'feel', 'like', 'number', 'processed', 'needed', 'help', 'processing', 'progress', 'turn', 'around', 'revolving', 'course', 'perch', 'nestled', 'heart', 'la', 'sit', 'amidst', 'la', 'famous', 'skyline', 'want', 'pictures', 'go', 'dining', 'neighbors', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'got', 'three', 'times', 'take', 'pictures', 'partner', 'dine', 'server', 'tried', 'hand', 'picture', 'taking', 'women', 'come', 'together', 'server', 'woman', 'photographed', 'partner', 'dine', 'photographed', 'server', 'get', 'good', 'pictures', 'important', 'people', 'pictures', 'important', 'come', 'guess', 'everyone', 'needs', 'go', 'perch', 'experience', 'promise', 'decide', 'fulfilled', 'lofty', 'reputation', 'demands']"

I would not get the malfadine again. The shrimp was rubbery. The pea starter with yogurt sauce was delicious with garlic on top.They have issues with pricing on the menu. The starter was 18 on the menu and on the bill it said 22. Same with the malfadine. It was 28 on the menu but 33 on the bill. Then the same owner/manager makes a comment about catching the mistake on his menu but it was like weirdly sketch. luckily they took the pea dish starter off which was kind of them but we left the malfadine since they already took the starter off. Aside from the weird owner's vibe, the staff is attentive and I was surprised about the little detail of storing your leftovers before you leave. I've never been to a restaurant that essentially has a coat check for your leftovers. Overall I would definitely come back for their pomodoro and to try the corn angliotti.","4921 W Adams Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90016",4.5,631,"Italian, Mediterranean, Tapas/Small Plates",$$,positive,1274,0.136,0.052,0.812,0.9756,0.988030577348622,0.7142857142857141,"['good', 'pasta', 'visit', 'weird', 'made', 'weird', 'comment', 'us', 'allowed', 'take', 'photos', 'food', 'came', 'meant', 'joke', 'star', 'rating', 'spicy', 'pomodoro', 'could', 'eat', 'entire', 'thing', 'without', 'thinking', 'shrimp', 'malfadine', 'salty', 'broccoli', 'bucatini', 'good', 'well', 'highly', 'recommend', 'bucatini', 'pomodoro', 'would', 'get', 'malfadine', 'shrimp', 'rubbery', 'pea', 'starter', 'yogurt', 'sauce', 'delicious', 'garlic', 'issues', 'pricing', 'menu', 'starter', 'menu', 'bill', 'said', 'malfadine', 'menu', 'bill', 'makes', 'comment', 'catching', 'mistake', 'menu', 'like', 'weirdly', 'sketch', 'luckily', 'took', 'pea', 'dish', 'starter', 'kind', 'left', 'malfadine', 'since', 'already', 'took', 'starter', 'aside', 'weird', 'owner', 'vibe', 'staff', 'attentive', 'surprised', 'little', 'detail', 'storing', 'leftovers', 'leave', 'never', 'restaurant', 'essentially', 'coat', 'check', 'leftovers', 'overall', 'would', 'definitely', 'come', 'back', 'pomodoro', 'try', 'corn', 'angliotti']"
60,2023-09-09,2023-09-17,Cento,"And just like that...after one visit to Cento, it's now one of my favorite restaurants in LA.Cento has a beautiful patio, built around a lovely tree, and draped in tiny white lights. The patio has a sandy floor, and it feels like you've been transported to a beachside Italian village. (Or, well, someplace other than the block of West Adams that it shares with an auto repair shop.)The service is exceptional. Attentive but not intrusive, with lots of lovely little touches, like storing your leftovers in their refrigerator until you're ready to leave.The cocktail menu is small and creative. I tried the Espresso & Date martini, with vodka, oat milk, aquafaba and orange, and it was superb--well-balanced and very unique. I also tried a sip (and then possibly three more sips when someone wasn't looking...) of the Fig & Walnut (with Scotch, sweet vermouth and apricot) and it was excellent. I'm excited to return and try the other four cocktails on the menu.Cento's menu is pretty seafood-heavy, so as someone who can't eat seafood, I worried that I wouldn't find much to eat. But in fact, I found too much to eat. (See the note about leftovers above.)We started with the Heirloom Radicchio Salad--with dates, pecan, and raspberry vinaigrette--and the presentation was astoundingly beautiful. It tasted even better.  Next up was the Farro Salad with roasted eggplant (that's blended into a sort of baba ghanoush and mixed into the salad), dill crème fraiche and pomegranate, and that was amazing, too. It looked very simple, but the flavors were astounding. I could eat vats of it.Then, it was time for pasta (!!!). We ordered three pastas for the two of us, because we simply couldn't decide (again, reference note about leftovers...). The Bolognese was my favorite--a super comforting dish of ricotta gnocchi in a phenomenal meat sauce. I also loved the Sweet Corn Agnolotti (charred corn, crème fraiche, Old Bay and chervil). Definitely don't miss that one. And finally, the Spicy Pomodoro (which was not very spicy at all, and I'm a spice wimp), because I saw it going to several other tables and had to try it. While it was my least favorite of the three, it was still great.And finally...dessert. DO. NOT. MISS. DESSERT. The Banana Pudding Tiramisu (a combination of things I wouldn't normally be into) was one of the best desserts I've ever had in life. It's their specialty. Just do it.","4921 W Adams Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90016",4.5,631,"Italian, Mediterranean, Tapas/Small Plates",$$,positive,2398,0.23,0.004,0.766,0.9987,0.9996479581573124,0.7142857142857141,"['like', 'one', 'visit', 'cento', 'one', 'favorite', 'restaurants', 'beautiful', 'patio', 'built', 'around', 'lovely', 'tree', 'draped', 'tiny', 'white', 'lights', 'patio', 'sandy', 'floor', 'feels', 'like', 'transported', 'beachside', 'italian', 'village', 'well', 'someplace', 'block', 'west', 'adams', 'shares', 'auto', 'repair', 'shop', 'service', 'exceptional', 'attentive', 'intrusive', 'lots', 'lovely', 'little', 'touches', 'like', 'storing', 'leftovers', 'refrigerator', 'ready', 'cocktail', 'menu', 'small', 'creative', 'tried', 'espresso', 'date', 'martini', 'vodka', 'oat', 'milk', 'aquafaba', 'orange', 'superb', 'unique', 'also', 'tried', 'sip', 'possibly', 'three', 'sips', 'someone', 'looking', 'fig', 'walnut', 'scotch', 'sweet', 'vermouth', 'apricot', 'excellent', 'excited', 'return', 'try', 'four', 'cocktails', 'menu', 'pretty', 'someone', 'ca', 'eat', 'seafood', 'worried', 'would', 'find', 'much', 'eat', 'fact', 'found', 'much', 'eat', 'see', 'note', 'leftovers', 'started', 'heirloom', 'radicchio', 'salad', 'dates', 'pecan', 'raspberry', 'vinaigrette', 'presentation', 'astoundingly', 'beautiful', 'tasted', 'even', 'better', 'next', 'farro', 'salad', 'roasted', 'eggplant', 'blended', 'sort', 'baba', 'ghanoush', 'mixed', 'salad', 'dill', 'crème', 'fraiche', 'pomegranate', 'amazing', 'looked', 'simple', 'flavors', 'astounding', 'could', 'eat', 'vats', 'time', 'pasta', 'ordered', 'three', 'pastas', 'two', 'us', 'simply', 'could', 'decide', 'reference', 'note', 'leftovers', 'bolognese', 'favorite', 'super', 'comforting', 'dish', 'ricotta', 'gnocchi', 'phenomenal', 'meat', 'sauce', 'also', 'loved', 'sweet', 'corn', 'agnolotti', 'charred', 'corn', 'crème', 'fraiche', 'old', 'bay', 'chervil', 'definitely', 'miss', 'one', 'finally', 'spicy', 'pomodoro', 'spicy', 'spice', 'wimp', 'saw', 'going', 'several', 'tables', 'try', 'least', 'favorite', 'three', 'still', 'finally', 'dessert', 'miss', 'dessert', 'banana', 'pudding', 'tiramisu', 'combination', 'things', 'would', 'normally', 'one', 'best', 'desserts', 'ever', 'life', 'specialty']"

63,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Jon & Vinny's Fairfax,"When the warmth and ambiance of a restaurant really hit you, it's a must you write a positive review and this is exactly what I'm doing. My buddies have been raving about JnV's for some time and I had to go and check it out myself. The restaurant itself is very pretty with an open kitchen and chefs that smile once you enter. The Fairfax location is the only one I've been to and it's usually busy with a lively crowd.For food, we definitely gravitated toward the pizzas. My personal favorite was the White Lightning pizza which I absolutely loved and had I not eaten it so quickly, I would've shared a picture of it. We have some mushroom lovers in the group and they also raved about the ""Super Shroom"" pizza which gives a more than generous amount of mushrooms.To finish, we had to order the ricotta cookies which are the definition of a nice petite dessert. It wasn't so petite when my friend decided to order more and ended up eating 16 cookies in 20 minutes. If ricotta cookies are your thing, I'd be sure to call ahead to make sure JnVs has enough ricotta cookies available as we happened to catch them on a lucky day.The last part, which I really want to emphasize is how great the service is. Calling to make a reservation is very easy but the service once you're seated is so above and beyond. Our table was greeted not only by the hosts, bussers and servers, but also happened to meet the chef, manager and GM as well. Service is quick and friendly, always checking to make sure that you have your food and drinks but also having a good time as well.Thanks Jon & Vinny's, we'll see you soon for your pizzas and ricotta cookies very very soon!","412 N Fairfax Ave Los Angeles, CA 90036",3.8,2431,"Italian, Breakfast & Brunch, Pizza",$$,positive,1654,0.177,0.0,0.823,0.9929,0.9967310400321867,0.2142857142857141,"['warmth', 'ambiance', 'restaurant', 'really', 'hit', 'must', 'write', 'positive', 'review', 'exactly', 'buddies', 'raving', 'jnv', 'time', 'go', 'check', 'restaurant', 'pretty', 'open', 'kitchen', 'chefs', 'smile', 'enter', 'fairfax', 'location', 'one', 'usually', 'busy', 'lively', 'food', 'definitely', 'gravitated', 'toward', 'pizzas', 'personal', 'favorite', 'white', 'lightning', 'pizza', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'eaten', 'quickly', 'would', 'shared', 'picture', 'mushroom', 'lovers', 'group', 'also', 'raved', 'super', 'shroom', 'pizza', 'gives', 'generous', 'amount', 'finish', 'order', 'ricotta', 'cookies', 'definition', 'nice', 'petite', 'dessert', 'petite', 'friend', 'decided', 'order', 'ended', 'eating', 'cookies', 'minutes', 'ricotta', 'cookies', 'thing', 'sure', 'call', 'ahead', 'make', 'sure', 'jnvs', 'enough', 'ricotta', 'cookies', 'available', 'happened', 'catch', 'lucky', 'last', 'part', 'really', 'want', 'emphasize', 'great', 'service', 'calling', 'make', 'reservation', 'easy', 'service', 'seated', 'beyond', 'table', 'greeted', 'hosts', 'bussers', 'servers', 'also', 'happened', 'meet', 'chef', 'manager', 'gm', 'well', 'service', 'quick', 'friendly', 'always', 'checking', 'make', 'sure', 'food', 'drinks', 'also', 'good', 'time', 'jon', 'vinny', 'see', 'soon', 'pizzas', 'ricotta', 'cookies', 'soon']"

It was 4PM, they close at 9PM, and when I asked they told me there were only three parties ahead of me. I then asked if they mostly run on reservations, and they told me no that they also do stand by. So in the 15 minutes we waited while trying to figure out if it was worth it to wait and see how long it was going to be, we got a table. So I don't understand why we were told we might not get a table.Then they sat us in a booth that was way too small for five people. My group consisted of three smaller teenagers, if we were average sized people we would have fared worse. I asked if we could please sit somewhere else (there were several empty tables, and no one else was waiting), but I was told no.Then we were told that patrons usually order tapas style. So we all order something with the intention of sharing. This was a mistake, the entrees were way to small and we had to order more food. Again, my group had small people in it, so we don't normally eat a lot and we left hungry.Lastly, the bill was way too high. And on top of the overpriced food, there was an additional 18% gratuity charge that was added onto the bill. I'll never return to this place again. The hassle, the weird vibes, and the price is not worth it for just 'ok' pasta.

There are booths and standard tables along the walls as well.The food was great and I actually can't wait to come back and have more of what I loved... which is:1. Fried mandu. Get the sampler. My favorites are the shrimp and jalapeno. Non standard, but they were so delicious. They fry the mandus so well - the outside is so crisp and the inside is fully packed with a generous portion of filling.2. Perilla buckwheat noodle. This is such a simple dish, but the perilla flavor was spot on and there was a hint of sweetness that brought out the flavor even more. The noodles are topped with a generous heaping of seaweed. The portion is huge and could be split into two different meals. The noodles themselves are cooked to just the right tenderness. Would definitely order again.3. Cold kimchi noodles. The bowl is GIANT. It's actually deceivingly huge. The broth is delicious, noodles are very chewy, and the kimchi doesn't actually make it too spicy.For two, we ordered the steamed mandu sampler, the fried mandu sampler, and the 2 noodle dishes. Both of us were extremely full and had leftovers to take home.PRO TIP: if you order an entree, you can add 3 mandus to your order for $3. This is a much better deal than ordering one order of 6 mandus for $9.99. And you can pick the type of mandu you want too!

Big enough to share but we could have each gotten one because it was so good.Tuna panzanella. 3/5 Like a mini poke salad with croutons. Pretty good.Pizzas:Guanciale. 5/5 A perfect pizza. Up there in level of deliciousness with Pizzeria Mozza's fennel sausage. The Guanciale bits are crisp and salty and really balance well with the creamy smooth cheese.Burrata. 5/5 Another winner with a flavor pop in each bite from the castelvetrano olives,The crusts of the pizzas are less crisp than some other Neapolitan pizzas and more airy and soft... reminiscent of a perfectly executed naan.Pastas.Squid ink spaghetti with crab. 4/5 Tender morsels of crab with very al dente thin spaghetti in a slightly briny sauce. Very balanced and flavorful.Ricotta gnocchi. 3/5 Perfectly textured gnocchi with a tomato sauce that you dip into their super creamy Burrata. The flavor reminded me of chef boyardee in only the best and most nostalgic way.Desserts:Chiffon cake with seared plums, nectarines and crème fraiche. 4/5 Delightfully light.Chocolate budino tart. 4/5 Well-balanced chocolate with salted caramel that isn't too sweet or overpowering.Service 5/5Cost/value 3/5.

I was shocked when my $38 pasta dish had around 20 pieces of tiny, .75 inch ravioli. Sadly, Bestia is the kind of restaurant where you spend $200 on food only to pickup Chipotle on the way home.The drink I ordered, the old fashioned, was a $19 bland liquid with a weak pour.At the end, the bill includes a 4% ""service charge"" that isn't a tip.The bill also lies about the subtotal.

Well, let me say it is by far the most I have ever spent on one meal. By far! So go in with your eyes open. But was it worth it? Unequivocally yes! It's not just the food it's the experience. If you watch The Bear you know that restaurants like Providence seek to give you a full experience because they know you're spending a lot of money. The food alone was excellent. Starting with the amuse bouche which was so good I didn't know how they would top it. But they did. Each course explained. The servers seamlessly tagged teamed our dining experience. I don't drink so while my wife had her wine pairings they were kind enough to set up mocktail pairings for me, which I don't think they'd done before. There were certain food I didn't care for. I went with most of it but they were really clear that they want you to so speak up and ask for what you need and want. (But don't be a d$@& about it ) As one of our servers said, ""Here, we want you to say something. Always say something. It is not your job to fit into our experience. It is our job to fit into your experience."" As someone who has been called high maintenance that was honestly really nice to hear. Everything was good. You get to take your time enjoying the meal and enjoying your company. It was our twenty year anniversary and it was a great way to begin to celebrate it! And here is the cherry on top: I forgot my business card there. At first they couldn't find it but Sarah looked a second time after we looked everywhere and she found it tucked into the bottom of the bill holder. That alone was above and beyond. But then they did not simply say come get when you can they asked where I lived and checked to see if someone might be able to drop it off! Drop it off at my house. Are you kidding me? Well, they did. It would have been a two hour trip with traffic for me to get it and I was leaving for business the next day. Who does that? Providence does. So if you want to have a special experience with amazing food and are willing to invest in it I highly recommend giving yourself the gift of Providence, at least once.","5955 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.4,2942,"American (New), Seafood",$$$$,positive,2388,0.213,0.026,0.762,0.9985,0.9995473747736875,0.6428571428571429,"['reading', 'review', 'one', 'main', 'questions', 'worth', 'first', 'meal', 'wine', 'pairing', 'upgrades', 'tax', 'tip', 'simple', 'addition', 'see', 'spend', 'lot', 'money', 'meal', 'worth', 'well', 'let', 'say', 'far', 'ever', 'spent', 'one', 'meal', 'far', 'go', 'eyes', 'open', 'worth', 'unequivocally', 'yes', 'food', 'experience', 'watch', 'bear', 'know', 'restaurants', 'like', 'providence', 'seek', 'give', 'full', 'experience', 'know', 'spending', 'lot', 'money', 'food', 'alone', 'excellent', 'starting', 'amuse', 'bouche', 'good', 'know', 'would', 'top', 'course', 'explained', 'servers', 'seamlessly', 'tagged', 'teamed', 'dining', 'experience', 'drink', 'wife', 'wine', 'pairings', 'kind', 'enough', 'set', 'mocktail', 'pairings', 'think', 'done', 'certain', 'food', 'care', 'went', 'really', 'clear', 'want', 'speak', 'ask', 'need', 'want', 'one', 'servers', 'said', 'want', 'say', 'something', 'always', 'say', 'something', 'job', 'fit', 'experience', 'job', 'fit', 'experience', 'someone', 'called', 'high', 'maintenance', 'honestly', 'really', 'nice', 'hear', 'everything', 'good', 'get', 'take', 'time', 'enjoying', 'meal', 'enjoying', 'company', 'twenty', 'year', 'anniversary', 'great', 'way', 'begin', 'celebrate', 'cherry', 'top', 'forgot', 'business', 'card', 'first', 'could', 'find', 'sarah', 'looked', 'second', 'time', 'looked', 'everywhere', 'found', 'tucked', 'bottom', 'bill', 'holder', 'alone', 'beyond', 'simply', 'say', 'come', 'get', 'asked', 'lived', 'checked', 'see', 'someone', 'might', 'able', 'drop', 'drop', 'house', 'kidding', 'well', 'would', 'two', 'hour', 'trip', 'traffic', 'get', 'leaving', 'business', 'next', 'day', 'providence', 'want', 'special', 'experience', 'amazing', 'food', 'willing', 'invest', 'highly', 'recommend', 'giving', 'gift', 'providence', 'least']"
82,2023-09-01,2023-09-17,Providence,"Providence was a very solid dinner experience with friendly and knowledgeable servers. The restaurant is fairly dark inside but each table has its own lamp, which adds a very intimate vibe. We found free street parking near the dmv about a block away but there is valet parking available too.We started the meal with two cocktails. I forgot what they were, but one had watermelon and the other had honey from the beehive on the second floor. Both were good and not too sweet. From the add-ons, we got uni egg with caviar which was a bit salty (most likely due to the caviar) but delicious, along with the rabbit tortellini which was good but could use some more flavor.For the main dinner menu, the amuse bouche was a great start with shiso wrapped tuna and several other small bites. We both loved the shima aji, but everything else lacked a similar wow factor. However, we both did not like the bread service. Compared to some other fine dining restaurants, the crust here was very hard to chew and might poke the inside of your mouth if you try to bite off the corner so be wary of that.We got the swordfish and the duck for the entrees. The swordfish was soft but didn't have a whole lot of flavor, but this was also my first time eating swordfish so I don't have anything to compare it with. However, we've eaten duck multiple times and the one here was good but not great. It was cooked well but the sauce could also use more flavor and salt.Onto dessert, the mango one was like a sorbet and tasted really good. Very fresh and flavorful mango. The chocolate dessert tasted somewhat like haagan daz which is a good thing, but needed more of the ice cream to balance out the chocolate. Then finally, there were a couple small bites and sweet coffee  to end the night.","5955 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.4,2942,"American (New), Seafood",$$$$,positive,1771,0.177,0.054,0.769,0.9943,0.9974351237175618,0.6428571428571429,"['providence', 'solid', 'dinner', 'experience', 'friendly', 'knowledgeable', 'servers', 'restaurant', 'fairly', 'dark', 'inside', 'table', 'lamp', 'adds', 'intimate', 'vibe', 'found', 'free', 'street', 'parking', 'near', 'dmv', 'block', 'away', 'valet', 'parking', 'available', 'started', 'meal', 'two', 'cocktails', 'forgot', 'one', 'watermelon', 'honey', 'beehive', 'second', 'floor', 'good', 'sweet', 'got', 'uni', 'egg', 'caviar', 'bit', 'salty', 'likely', 'due', 'caviar', 'delicious', 'along', 'rabbit', 'tortellini', 'good', 'could', 'use', 'main', 'dinner', 'menu', 'amuse', 'bouche', 'great', 'start', 'shiso', 'wrapped', 'tuna', 'several', 'small', 'bites', 'loved', 'shima', 'aji', 'everything', 'else', 'lacked', 'similar', 'wow', 'factor', 'however', 'like', 'bread', 'service', 'compared', 'fine', 'dining', 'restaurants', 'crust', 'hard', 'chew', 'might', 'poke', 'inside', 'mouth', 'try', 'bite', 'corner', 'wary', 'got', 'swordfish', 'duck', 'entrees', 'swordfish', 'soft', 'whole', 'lot', 'flavor', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'eating', 'swordfish', 'anything', 'compare', 'however', 'eaten', 'duck', 'multiple', 'times', 'one', 'good', 'great', 'cooked', 'well', 'sauce', 'could', 'also', 'use', 'flavor', 'dessert', 'mango', 'one', 'like', 'sorbet', 'tasted', 'really', 'good', 'fresh', 'flavorful', 'mango', 'chocolate', 'dessert', 'tasted', 'somewhat', 'like', 'haagan', 'daz', 'good', 'thing', 'needed', 'ice', 'cream', 'balance', 'chocolate', 'finally', 'couple', 'small', 'bites', 'sweet', 'coffee', 'end', 'night']"

The kebab was visually more the traditional beef kebab you'd expect but the quality was more like a high grade steak and so juicy and yummy. The shislik was made from ground beef and heavily seasoned in the best way and had a unique flavor.

There were so much meat and veggies in the soup and it went great with rice! It gave me such a homey feeling. Definitely would recommend this!The seok pork spare ribs were very good too! The marinade they used wasn't overly sweet and it was just super delicious! But they do put this on a portable stove at your table so it keeps cooking. The meat may get a bit tough later if you don't turn off the stove.I read an article saying that Lee Ga makes their own naengmyeon noodles. They even have a machine that makes it, which is one of the reasons we got it. The noodles were great -- texture is chewy and bouncy. I feel like the broth was a bit under seasoned? There wasn't much flavor to it and the broth wasn't icy. Maybe it's because we had the gukbap first and the gukbap had so much flavor that the naengmyeon seemed bland.The kimchi dumplings were pretty dry though.

We have been here three times so far and will definitely visit again when we can. Their food is always amazing and fresh. And their service is always exceptional, making us feel very welcomed. Interesting decor, kinda a mix of our kind of quirkiness with robot figures and toys, plus techno or house music. They got a cool DJ booth, too, definitely has the potential to be a great event space.Our repeat order:KBBQ Chicken - Super crispy and juicy fried chicken coated with a delicious sweet and savory sauce. Portion is pretty much about a whole chicken! The breading they used tasted like sweet potato, which I love. 10/10Other things we're tried:Ginja Odengtang, added beef tendon and boiled egg - perfectly seasoned dashi broth soup with fish cakes for late night or cold weather comfort. The beef tendon was very tasty! It comes with a side of house-made pickled daikon, carrot and pickle. And again, the portion is great. It can probably feed 3-4 people. 10/10Johnson Tang (Korean Army Stew), added ramen - yum yum yum! The soup stock is so flavorful! Lots of sausages, ham, kimchi, onion, and topped with cheese. They pre-cooked the ramen to perfection, and put it on a large separate bowl for us so we can dig right in without waiting for the ramen to cook. Whatever sauce they made for the stock is amazing, adding a nice depth to the flavor. Great portion size as usual. 10/10Pork Belly Bossam - tender pork belly slices, yet again perfectly seasoned and great portion size. Love love love the stir-fried kimchi side 10/10House Smoked Salmon Plate - thick slices of smoked salmon topped with shaved lemon peel, diced onion, capers, fresh lemon slices, and a house made dipping sauce. Very yummy! The shaved lemon peel is a very very nice touch. 10/10Karaage Salad - very crispy and juicy fried chicken pieces and salad with a yummy ginger-ish dressing 10/10+ an assortment of beer and liquor, plus delicious soju highball mixed drinks.++ sometimes they give us a side of thin, sweet potato friesIdk, we just love this neighborhood place so much.

93,2023-09-06,2023-09-17,Yup Dduk LA,"I've been wanting to come here for a couple years or so now. First time I'd heard of this place the line was out the door and long so my friends and I ended up at a different restaurant in the same plaza. Since then, every time I pass through town and research Yelp for yummy places to eat, this one seems to keep popping up. But then, I'm usually alone and it seemed like too much food for one. Boy was I right!We were a party of three this time. It was close to 8pm on a Tuesday night so the wait was maybe 15-20 minutes. After reviewing the menu, I realized this menu did not offer diet food. There were no fresh vegetables in their offerings. Sometimes, you just need an indulging meal.The space is quite small. Depending on the table configurations there were a maximum of 4-5 table sets possible. But this tinyness of the space added to the charm. People came in and out to grab takeout while all the tables were filled. It amused me that all the customers at the time of our visit were probably all under the age of 25, except us.And then I saw all their bowls of Tteokbokki on their tables. They weren't regular bowls, they were GIANT bowls full of sticky noodles covered in spicy gochujang style red sauces, covered in gooey cheese. We ordered Yup Dduk, Set C. In our order there was yam noodles (the kind Japchae is made of), fried onion rings and fried zucchini, fish cake, a couple small pieces of sausage and maybe some other things. Being an ""older customer"" my body can't necessarily handle such a carb loaded meal. But, my eyes and taste buds feasted on this dish! It was delish! I think this bowl could have fed 6 people! We had plenty of leftovers. On the side, the only vegetable to be considered was pickled radish.

From sneering when we initially asked for water to only carding me even though the entire table ordered alcoholic drinks (I was not the youngest nor did I look it, but I was the only Asian person...), he acted as if we were inconveniencing him and wanted us gone.He never returned once we got our food and after sitting around for 20+ min after finishing, someone from our table finally got up and walked to the counter to ask another server for the bill and boxes.

Friend arrives and we decide on our entrees.We both ordered salads. Mine, the Mediterranean Salad with salmon came out looking good. My friend's, the Asian Chopped Salad was covered in edamame despite its removal being requested and the ordered salmon wasn't there. After fixing the salad, a few bites in there was a hair. They addressed this by replacing the salad and comping the first salad but not the salmon. It was an odd way to fix the issue but my friend wasn't mad so neither was I.Another attempt to soothe things was selling us on the idea that their bread was good so we ordered some. It was warm and tasteless. A little olive oil drizzle with some garlic would've gone a long way.

Honestly, the only negative I would say would be one, you may have to wait here a while. My understanding is they do not take reservations, and while we were seated immediately, we came at 9 o'clock at night on a Tuesday, arguably one of the slowest times for a restaurant. And the place was still packed.We got the crab as a bowl, which means they pre-clean the crabs for you, but for the full experience, you are supposed to do it yourself. I did take some of that to go, and it was similarly delicious. However, the luxury of having them do it is not something I would complain about. They also give you a crab soup on the side which was very tasty, and a few side dishes. I was particularly fond of the perilla leaves.Bathroom is also very clean, and although the price is a little steep, this is one of the only games in town I understand for this type of product that level of freshness.

Research led me to multiple restaurants in Ktown and Master Ha was one of the most talked about. Since we were worried about peak times, we visited in the middle of the afternoon and found the place empty.Medium Marinated Crab: A medium size is 2 whole crabs, cut into pieces. Each person (we had 3) also got a bowl of rice and crab miso soup. Gloves are provided and it's highly recommended to use these because it's just easier to squeeze out the crab meat with your hands. Take a bite with rice or wrap it in the provided seaweed. SO GOOD! Takes me back to Korea but the only problem is the price. The crab miso soup was even better, maybe even better than the marinated crab itself.Regular Live Uni: Comes with 4 halves of a live uni, filled with rice, roe, 3 pieces of (small) uni, and a raw quail egg. If you want premium, I think that just comes with more uni. This is an IG-worthy dish, very aesthetic. But I could've done without it. You can easily finish each half in like two bites and it's pretty expensive because of the uni.Overall, pretty satisfied with the meal but it's just so expensive compared to Korea. This is definitely not something to be enjoyed often, unless you have the money for it.

The dishes come with rice, a few kimchi side dishes, and some soup. We also got steamed egg but its super small so i would pass on that.First off the uni was my favorite but maybe since its not in season / just starting it wasn't that fresh. I think they definitely try to mask it with quail egg and a lot of seasame oil. I really did like this dish but do wish they used better quality uni itself.

105,2023-09-02,2023-09-17,Meteora,"First and foremost to Jordan Kahn for a remarkable meal. We visited for the Cos wine paired dinner. I appreciated the molecular gastronomy very much, the well balanced dishes, all presented beautifully. It would have been five stars if not for the snarky staff.The decor was interesting, created a dark, intriguiging mood. The tableware was original and fun.All of our servers were great, but could have been more detailed with the very original, and unique dishes, how they were prepared, what techniques, and the background of the unusual products. However, the host/floor manager who came by a couple of times was rude, snippy, unprofessional, and unpleasant considering we each paid over $200 per plate for the evening. The place was quite empty. We asked to be moved to the patio to have a bit more peace as the music was loud with a driving beat. He said the music would soften, but it did not. He refused to bring it down a notch. We could barely focus on the food. The answer was a curt ""no"", with no reasoning whatsoever.My dining partner asked for a bit more wine with the first tasting. We had driven 90 minutes to the restaurant on a busy night and she wanted to relax. The host or floor manager's reply was a snippy, ""You'll get your 3 glasses in. No. We can't serve you any more of the tasting wine.""  Such rudeness and assumption we were there for 3 glasses of wine? Seriously?The final issue were the restrooms. One was unusable as some male had missed the toilet altogether and the floor was a puddle of personal ""liquid"" and the other toilet was clogged. Co-gender restrooms may be ""in"", but again, when you've planned for a nice evening out, visiting a smelly or messy restroom is just disgusting.We won't be going back. The food was quite good, but the experience of the loud pounding music, the host/floor manager's attitude, brought for a pretty unplesant evening altogether, and for $200+ per person, it's highway robbery.","6703 Melrose Avenue Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.0,320,American (New),$$$$,positive,1945,0.122,0.081,0.797,0.9045,0.9522731844699256,0.35714285714285704,"['first', 'foremost', 'jordan', 'kahn', 'remarkable', 'meal', 'visited', 'cos', 'wine', 'paired', 'dinner', 'appreciated', 'molecular', 'gastronomy', 'much', 'well', 'balanced', 'dishes', 'presented', 'beautifully', 'would', 'five', 'stars', 'snarky', 'decor', 'interesting', 'created', 'dark', 'intriguiging', 'mood', 'tableware', 'original', 'servers', 'great', 'could', 'detailed', 'original', 'unique', 'dishes', 'prepared', 'techniques', 'background', 'unusual', 'products', 'however', 'manager', 'came', 'couple', 'times', 'rude', 'snippy', 'unprofessional', 'unpleasant', 'considering', 'paid', 'per', 'plate', 'evening', 'place', 'quite', 'empty', 'asked', 'moved', 'patio', 'bit', 'peace', 'music', 'loud', 'driving', 'beat', 'said', 'music', 'would', 'soften', 'refused', 'bring', 'notch', 'could', 'barely', 'focus', 'food', 'answer', 'curt', 'reasoning', 'dining', 'partner', 'asked', 'bit', 'wine', 'first', 'tasting', 'driven', 'minutes', 'restaurant', 'busy', 'night', 'wanted', 'relax', 'host', 'floor', 'manager', 'reply', 'snippy', 'get', 'glasses', 'ca', 'serve', 'tasting', 'wine', 'rudeness', 'assumption', 'glasses', 'wine', 'seriously', 'final', 'issue', 'restrooms', 'one', 'unusable', 'male', 'missed', 'toilet', 'altogether', 'floor', 'puddle', 'personal', 'liquid', 'toilet', 'clogged', 'restrooms', 'may', 'planned', 'nice', 'evening', 'visiting', 'smelly', 'messy', 'restroom', 'wo', 'going', 'back', 'food', 'quite', 'good', 'experience', 'loud', 'pounding', 'music', 'manager', 'attitude', 'brought', 'pretty', 'unplesant', 'evening', 'altogether', 'per', 'person', 'highway', 'robbery']"

Service was great and we left loving this place.Recently we went right at opening at 6 PM on a Sunday. There was only one other party beside us, no music, and just one worker. Each table has a button you can press whenever you needed something. Service was okay. The waiter only came when we pressed the button. He wasn't attentive so we didn't get water refilled and had to flag him down to order.Scallop Skewer: Tiny scallop balls that weren't good. Hard pass.Spicy Cheese Chicken & Rice Balls ($32.99): This was really good, and perfect to share with 2-3 people.Pork Belly With Fried Kimchi (23.99): The pork belly was dry and flavorless. They gave a sauce to dip it in but that didn't help. The fried kimchi  was amazing but it still doesn't justify the price.Galbi Sauce Fried Chicken ($19.99): This was bomb! The sauce was so good on the chicken and rice cake which were both fried to perfection. The fries were meh though. Also, the portion size has shrunk from the last time we were here.Fish Cake Soup ($22.99): My friend was raving about this and it did not disappoint! The soup along was super flavorful and had a nice little kick to it. The fish cake was delicious, one of the best I had. I wasn't a fan of the fat stick of rice cake though.","3526 W 8th St Los Angeles, CA 90005",4.7,471,"Korean, Bars",$$,positive,1448,0.176,0.063,0.761,0.9893,0.9949205391269362,0.8571428571428571,"['overall', 'dine', 'came', 'group', 'early', 'late', 'night', 'better', 'night', 'place', 'popping', 'music', 'gives', 'korean', 'pub', 'vibe', 'service', 'great', 'left', 'loving', 'went', 'right', 'opening', 'pm', 'sunday', 'one', 'party', 'beside', 'us', 'music', 'one', 'worker', 'table', 'button', 'press', 'whenever', 'needed', 'something', 'service', 'okay', 'waiter', 'came', 'pressed', 'button', 'attentive', 'get', 'water', 'refilled', 'flag', 'skewer', 'tiny', 'scallop', 'balls', 'good', 'hard', 'cheese', 'chicken', 'rice', 'balls', 'really', 'good', 'perfect', 'share', 'belly', 'fried', 'kimchi', 'pork', 'belly', 'dry', 'flavorless', 'gave', 'sauce', 'dip', 'help', 'fried', 'kimchi', 'amazing', 'still', 'justify', 'sauce', 'fried', 'chicken', 'bomb', 'sauce', 'good', 'chicken', 'rice', 'cake', 'fried', 'perfection', 'fries', 'meh', 'though', 'also', 'portion', 'size', 'shrunk', 'last', 'time', 'cake', 'soup', 'friend', 'raving', 'disappoint', 'soup', 'along', 'super', 'flavorful', 'nice', 'little', 'kick', 'fish', 'cake', 'delicious', 'one', 'best', 'fan', 'fat', 'stick', 'rice', 'cake', 'though']"

Felt like some amateur food made at home, and the host was not very welcoming. It was packed inside, so we asked to sit outside, which was pretty empty. Only one table had 2 guests and then my guest and I came. We were seated at a table for two, and because it was empty, we decided to move to a table that would seat 4. The host came to find out and said, ""I thought I made myself clear. I told you to sit over there, for a table of two."" I understand that they may have expected to get busy for the evening, but I was caught off guard with ""I thought I made myself clear"", like we were getting disciplined.I love Japanese skewers and have eaten them at various restaurants in different parts of L.A., San Francisco, San Jose, New York, etc..I wanted to try a new place and that is how we ended up at Izakaya Osen, which is the worst for Japanese skewers. I highly doubt these were grilled. After years of eating these, I found Izakaya Osen to be a place that should probably reconsider how they're cooked. Definitely not being grilled here.We also ordered a couple of hand rolls, and the presentation and quality of food felt like we were at home and took our chances on trying to making some.Never coming here again. Too expensive for what is offered, and the waitress kept waiting for us to pay and struggled to leave us be at our table..

Getting reservations was a breeze, setting the tone for an evening filled with culinary delights.Upon arrival, we opted for seats at the bar, which turned out to be an excellent choice. The cozy and vibrant atmosphere at the bar added to the overall charm of the place. Yum I was out server and she was amazingNow, let's talk about the star of the show - the food. We started our culinary journey with the Kushiyaka, featuring a delightful combination of chicken gizzards and sea bass. The flavors were exquisite, and it was a testament to the chef's skill.Next up, we couldn't resist trying the crab hand roll, which was a true masterpiece. The generous helping of crab paired with perfectly seasoned rice and wrapped in seaweed made each bite an absolute delight.The seaweed salad with pickles was a refreshing interlude, offering a balance of textures and tastes. It was a delightful way to cleanse our palates before moving on to the next course.The Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice was another standout dish. The contrast between the spicy tuna and the crispy rice base created an explosion of flavors in our mouths. It was a creative and delectable twist on a classic.As if that weren't enough, the sea bass Seabass Croquette was the perfect finale to our culinary adventure. The croquette was crispy on the outside, revealing a melt-in-your-mouth sea bass interior. It was a symphony of flavors and textures that left us craving for more.To complement our meal, we enjoyed a Kirin Ichiban beer, which was the ideal choice to accompany the diverse flavors of our dishes.In summary, our visit to this restaurant was a delightful journey through Japanese cuisine, highlighted by attentive service, a vibrant atmosphere, and dishes that were nothing short of spectacular. Whether you're a seasoned foodie or just looking for a memorable dining experience, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this place a try. It's a culinary adventure you won't want to miss.

After 40ish mins or so we then went to the bar and ordered the 2nd round. I asked the bar goer/s what were they drinking and they recommended the Palomar. I looked at the ingredients of the drink and asked if there were any cotton candy (which is on the menu) and they said no. So I jokingly asked the bartender ((Rob (shift around 10 ish 11pm) on 08/31)) if there were any discounts for the drinks due to the lack of the missing ingredient, cotton candy and he made a remark to me of having an immigrant mentality.  I find this is super offensive.

119,2023-09-15,2023-09-17,Firefly,"Celebrated a special occasion here. From the outside, the restaurant looks very lowkey. When you first enter, you'll see the bar where you can order drinks. Walk a little further and then there is the library lounge. If your table isn't ready yet, you can hang out there.We got seated at the outdoor patio. To start, I had the Pineapple Express cocktail. It was pretty good. I also tried the Western Sour cocktail, which was not bad. It was kind of unfortunate though that they did not bring us any water and we had to end up asking for some.Considering this is a nice restaurant, I was expecting better customer service. But the service was just average. They initially brought our cocktails to the wrong table. Then brought our appetizers to the wrong table. Then again brought the rest of our food to the wrong table.For appetizers, I tried the Meatballs and Bigeye Tuna Tartare. Both were delicious. The meatballs were perfectly cooked and full of flavor, while the tuna was fresh.The Mushroom Pappardelle was defintely my favorite dish of the night. The pasta had a delicious truffle cream and lots of mushrooms. The Steak Frites was much less enjoyable. I requested the filet mignon to be cooked medium rare of course. The meat was not tender and kind of bland even with the sauce. At least the frites were nice and crispy and came with a yummy garlic aioli dipping sauce.Got a side of Garlic Smashed Potatoes, which I really liked. The potatoes were soft and the saffron aioli was unique in a good way.To end the meal, I had a Molten Chocolate Cake. The taste of the chocolate was very strong. Eating the cake together with the horchata ice cream was a perfect combination.Valet is your best option for parking.

119,2023-09-09,2023-09-17,Firefly,"I'm pretty critical with places when the price is high and can set a high bar. In this case it's a 4.75. Disclosure: I read reviews where people complained about waiting a long time after being seated for food or service. Let me say that you can wait awhile BUT stop and take in the atmosphere, vibe and company you came with and that won't matter. For what you'll spend, relax and enjoy your time.Waiter was very nice, attentive and genuine. We got the Mac and Cheese, Meetball appetizer, Shrimp fettuccine and Pappadella Mushroom pasta. All the food was great. Only recommendation is the Shrimp Pasta only had 3 shrimp. The meatball appetizer SHOULD definitely be a pasta dish on the menu! That sauce is amazing! The sauces and pastas were great. The sauces were the kind you want to dip your bread in and take in every bite. (Foodies know what I'm talking about) Being Portuguese, we're VERY critical about pasta and sauce and what is ""wipe the plate clean status"".The bread comes with a butter and sauce on top of the butter. Texture, taste and presentation made this place I'd have special occasions at for sure.The ONLY two things that were disappointing is parking and the bathroom. Parking does not exist and is on a very busy street. Your only options are Valet at currently $10 or park a distance and walk there.The bathroom is a unisex bathroom with three sinks located to the left, 3 stalls and one bathroom at the end with a men's urinal. Twice I had to use the restroom and the seat of the toilet was up. No big deal but something I'd like to avoid having to deal with.Overall great place. Hope to see the meatball appetizer be a main dish with pasta AND will definitely come back day one it hits the menu.Note: Didn't post pictures of the food because the pics already on here match what I'm saying.

They aren't only knows for having the most amazing interiors (you literally feel like you're inside and outside all in the same setting) but they also have amazing food and exceptional service. We came for my mother in laws birthday and everything was top notch.

We were greeted pleasantly by the hostess and she acknowledged our anniversary. She mentioned that there would be a short wait till our cabana would be ready so we took a seat at their bar. The Bartendar was engaging and took our drink order, I had my go to drink a Moscow Mule and my wife had their signature Hot in the City drink. Both cocktails were delicious and very well crafted. We also ordered the Spanish Octopus ti enjoy at the bar, it came on top of an herb salad puréed in ingredients that made the dish very flavorful.  Our table became available and the waiter was nice enough to take our unfinished appetizer to our table and also offered to take our picture while at the bar.Our waitress, Alexandra greeted us with complimentary wine and also acknowledged our anniversary. She was amazing, attentive, and made recommendations that we loved. We ordered from the prix -fixe menu, I had the Atlantic Salmon and my wife ordered the Steak Frites. Both entrees were delicious, delectable, and simply delicious.  Our waitress brought desserts with candles to continue the anniversary celebration that just made the evening extra special.This restaurant is top notch from their service, ambiance, decor, to the food being serviced. It's very apparent that Management has incorporated a culture of excellence.The ambiance here is so lively and festive with up beat music playing in the back ground loud enough to hear but not loud enough to drown out our conversation.

And she made us some killer drinks not too strong but not watered down they were literally perfect!!! When we arrived our table wasn't ready yet since it had rained and some tables weren't available so we sat at the bar and met the lovely Britney. She recommended us to get the French bagguette with steak frites and the mushroom pappardelle! And she did not disappoint it was one of the greatest meals I've ever had no joke. Then we got sat and our waiter Mayron was so friendly! He brought us some cute little wine samples they were delicious and he recommended the toffee cake for dessert and it was amazing!!!! He asked my boyfriend while I was in the bathroom if we were celebrating anything and my partner said ""just love"" and Mayron put a little sparkler on our dessert and I just thought that was soooooo cute and sweet! It's the small details like that, that really make an experience so much better so shout out to Mayron you were amazing!!!

120,2023-08-21,2023-09-17,Mr. T,"I came back from a work trip and thought driving up from San Diego to LA on a Friday night was worth a bit of a splurge for dinner. Mr. T was near my place and I had it down as a 'one day soon,' place, somewhere that needed a bit of an occasion to go to and not just a regular place. The minimalist interior, the neon sign it definitely didn't have that 'Tuesday night dinner' kind of vibe.I gambled that it wouldn't be packed on a Friday night and while it was busy it was very easy to get a table on their patio which was open enough to be mellow but seemed to magically block out the cement plant across the street.I wasn't driving so when the server came by I ordered their twist on an Old Fashioned, the Double Up. I've decried a 20 dollar cocktail before and I will again here-but it was tasty, that can't be denied. I think fat-washed spirits are a bit much, or I did until here, it wasn't just the flavor but the heft of it. The coconut oil was a better call then say bacon fat, which I think leaves too much residue. Look, it's 20 bucks, I still think it's a bit overpriced but I'd get it again while grumbling that it might be 2 bucks more than it should.What I'm definitely more comfortable splurging on are appetizers/small plates/shareables so the lamb kebab, chip n' dip and the croquettes were all ordered and devoured. The kebab was delicious with the lamb being right at the edge of tender/game-y. The chip and dip was like an upscale version of a basic starter but not overly so, a little tartness, a little savory. Perfect. The croquettes though, all veg, but still so rich.I figured if they could do chips and dip up why not have their burger. I have a clip of the flambe which was a nice touch but without the theatrics it was still a very well-done burger with a bonus of char and that spicy aioli that came with the fries.Our server was so great that it didn't take much convincing to get their desserts which also seemed really simply but done well.

As a person who loves Japanese food and the culture around it as well, this place just rings true and the food was just something that is extremely memorable.I met Courtney, one of the owners, and she was introduced by my friend who seems to frequent their bar. And that Ototo is the lilttle brother location of their main location, literally beside it, Tsubaki. Their story seems extremely interesting and it really speaks through their food.The vibe and the aesthetic of the bar is very trendy while at the same time it reminds me of when I was in Japan with their bar setting. I love how it is categorized as a sake bar and the amounts of sake they offered was just emaculate! I couldn't say no to sake!!If I remember the menu that night, which I kinda don't but I took pictures of them so I think I'll try to describe them. Their food is just delicious and off the hook though. I wish we had something like that in Vancouver. I know, this coming from the city of sushi abundence..... This is so rare.Soft Shell Shrimp: 7/10Fish paste skewers?: 8/10Tomato Flavour bombs?: 100/10 (Yes 100 out of 10, these are fucking amazing.

125,2023-09-14,2023-09-17,Home Restaurant - Los Feliz,"TLDR: 2 stars for service; 4 stars for foodThis 3 star review is targeted at their bar set up. Dropped by for brunch on Labor Day weekend around 11am for a party of two. Parking is strictly street parking in the area so give yourself time to circle around the neighborhood. As I put my name down on the list and was quoted ~30 min wait I was also advised that the bar area was open with no wait. My friend and I walked into the bar and saw some high top tables open. We sat on one after confirming with a waiter walking by that those too were considered the ""bar area"". We could see the bartenders making drinks and assumed we would be given menus shortly.About 10 mins passed and nobody had approached us. Behind us was another couple and we leaned over and asked if they had ordered at the bar since they had menus and we weren't sure if that was the expectation. They told us they had been waiting for 20 mins and nobody had come up to them either. They were given menus when they first sat down and told someone would come up to them. They had even walked up to the bar and asked if they needed to put their order there and they were told that again someone would come up to them.That nice couple offered their menus and all four of us continued to wait. At this point it's been 20 mins for us and probably 30 mins for them and despite waiters walking back and forth nobody stopped to check in on us. At this point the other couple goes up to the bar and they let them put in an order there (which if you ask me they should have let them do that when they first asked). At this point I get a text my table will be ready in 5 mins and to confirm I'm still there. The couple tells us that we should just go up to the bar and I tell them we waited long enough that our table was now ready - so much for no wait time at the bar! We left the couple inside the bar area with no food or even water offered to them!!My friend and I were taken to a table in their patio which is really cute and shaded. We ordered the French toast and the green chilaquiles with avocado and medium easy eggs to split. I also got an iced latte.The food was awesome which only makes the whole experience so disappointing. Your service can really tank what was a really tasty meal. The French toast was super fluffy and not too sweet. The berries on the French toast were very fresh and the syrup was warm.The chilaquiles were incredible. I would definitely get these again - they had a nice kick and there was a perfect amount of sauce so the chips weren't soggy. My latte was also very good - it wasn't bitter.Our server was very pleasant and the service once we were at the table was very fast and efficient. Out the door about $50 for both of us which is a great price for food in this part of town.Overall, I wouldn't recommend the bar area if it truly is always this dysfunctional. I was genuinely shocked at how horrible that whole bar experience was and I felt terrible for the other couple who didn't put their name down for a table and were just waiting for service that never came. Just wait for the table if it's always this bad because the food is honestly worth it!","1760 Hillhurst Ave Los Angeles, CA 90027",4.1,3762,"Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea, American (New)",$$,positive,3154,0.103,0.049,0.848,0.9886,0.9945684972842487,0.4285714285714282,"['tldr', 'stars', 'service', 'stars', 'foodthis', 'star', 'review', 'targeted', 'bar', 'set', 'dropped', 'brunch', 'labor', 'day', 'weekend', 'around', 'party', 'two', 'parking', 'strictly', 'street', 'parking', 'area', 'give', 'time', 'circle', 'around', 'neighborhood', 'put', 'name', 'list', 'quoted', 'min', 'wait', 'also', 'advised', 'bar', 'area', 'open', 'wait', 'friend', 'walked', 'bar', 'saw', 'high', 'top', 'tables', 'open', 'sat', 'one', 'confirming', 'waiter', 'walking', 'considered', 'bar', 'area', 'could', 'see', 'bartenders', 'making', 'drinks', 'assumed', 'would', 'given', 'menus', 'mins', 'passed', 'nobody', 'approached', 'us', 'behind', 'us', 'another', 'couple', 'leaned', 'asked', 'ordered', 'bar', 'since', 'menus', 'sure', 'expectation', 'told', 'us', 'waiting', 'mins', 'nobody', 'come', 'either', 'given', 'menus', 'first', 'sat', 'told', 'someone', 'would', 'come', 'even', 'walked', 'bar', 'asked', 'needed', 'put', 'order', 'told', 'someone', 'would', 'come', 'nice', 'couple', 'offered', 'menus', 'four', 'us', 'continued', 'wait', 'point', 'mins', 'us', 'probably', 'mins', 'despite', 'waiters', 'walking', 'back', 'forth', 'nobody', 'stopped', 'check', 'us', 'point', 'couple', 'goes', 'bar', 'let', 'put', 'order', 'ask', 'let', 'first', 'asked', 'point', 'get', 'text', 'table', 'ready', 'mins', 'confirm', 'still', 'couple', 'tells', 'us', 'go', 'bar', 'tell', 'waited', 'long', 'enough', 'table', 'ready', 'much', 'wait', 'time', 'bar', 'left', 'couple', 'inside', 'bar', 'area', 'food', 'even', 'water', 'offered', 'friend', 'taken', 'table', 'patio', 'really', 'cute', 'shaded', 'ordered', 'french', 'toast', 'green', 'chilaquiles', 'avocado', 'medium', 'easy', 'eggs', 'split', 'also', 'got', 'iced', 'food', 'awesome', 'makes', 'whole', 'experience', 'disappointing', 'service', 'really', 'tank', 'really', 'tasty', 'meal', 'french', 'toast', 'super', 'fluffy', 'sweet', 'berries', 'french', 'toast', 'fresh', 'syrup', 'chilaquiles', 'incredible', 'would', 'definitely', 'get', 'nice', 'kick', 'perfect', 'amount', 'sauce', 'chips', 'soggy', 'latte', 'also', 'good', 'server', 'pleasant', 'service', 'table', 'fast', 'efficient', 'door', 'us', 'great', 'price', 'food', 'part', 'would', 'recommend', 'bar', 'area', 'truly', 'always', 'dysfunctional', 'genuinely', 'shocked', 'horrible', 'whole', 'bar', 'experience', 'felt', 'terrible', 'couple', 'put', 'name', 'table', 'waiting', 'service', 'never', 'came', 'wait', 'table', 'always', 'bad', 'food', 'honestly', 'worth']"

We called ahead and they were able to prepare a table for us (8ppl) & only 7 minutes away.Upon entering, and throughout the whole time, the elderly couple and server were so welcoming and warm. They interacted with us and were very helpful. They answered questions we had and accommodated our substitution request. (Nothing big, just asked if we could have 2 spice crabs in the combo)Pancakes are thinner than usual but yummy. Texture is crispy and not soggy and great flavor.

Smaller than expected but it was really good. Not like your typical kimchi pancake that's overly thick and soggy.The banchan was 10/10. Really enjoyed just eating the banchan with rice. That's how good it was.Note: their combos only include 1 crab of each, regardless of the size you choose. The only difference between the combo is the soup size.

128,2023-08-16,2023-09-17,Rich Crab,"I'm not a crab connoisseur so maybe take my review with a grain of salt. First off, I love seafood and I love to eat crab but to caveat, I've never had a general liking for the crab/shrimp heads - and eating raw crab was fairly similar to that delicacy.This was my first time eating raw crab. I wasn't sure what to expect so I came in with zero expectations, but I also walked out unsure of how I felt about the meal.I came here with a party of 4. Since it was our first time, we tried the combo so that we can try both of the different flavors. We ordered a size S combo A for $119. Note that the different sizes of combo refers to the stew size. Everything else comes as 1 count.The service was great. Food came out SO fast, it literally felt like we just waited for 5 mins. As soon as it came out, we dug in. I want to say I did enjoy the soy sauce marinated crab but at the same time also wasn't sure if I liked the flavors. The spicy marinated crab was marinated VERY well and spicy too! Loved that there was definitely a hot kick to it. You forsure need to work to eat this though and unfortunately, I'm not a huge fan of peeling crab/shrimp and really digging deep to find gold. Despite all that, it tasted super fresh!The banchan was exceptionally good, and also refillable. Kimchi was great but honestly felt like I got jipped. It's so thin and hardly had any kimchi pieces - it was like eating kimchi paper, not pancake. It was also smaller than what I expected. I've had better kimchi pancakes.We ordered the spicy crab stew for our stew option. Spicy? No. Crabby? Yes. It had a very good depth of flavor in terms of crab. I wish there was more garneses/veggies but the crab pretty much filled up the pot. I didn't get to eat the crab from the pot but I was told by my boyfriend's parents that it wasn't fresh.To be completely honest, I left feeling so unsatisfied. It wasn't that I wasn't full but I think I needed something that tasted more satisfying. I think this delicacy is something everyone should try but I wouldn't consider this a meal I'd crave and want to eat for dinner. To try and experience different types of cultural food? Definitely. But not something I can expect to eat every month. Also, I felt it was super pricey for what it was even though I know these crabs are imported. I'd prefer to eat omakase sashimi for the price.Update: After reading some reviews, I found out from other yelpers that ordering the combo, the crabs would be significantly smaller than ordering a la carte. The waitress failed to mention that to us...which now makes me realize that portioning sizes like this is incredibly unfair to the customer AND super misleading. Not to mention that most people who order combos expect to have a fair ratio amongst the number of people that the menu stated to feed. If your size M combo is supposed to feed 3, give more ratio of crabs rather than your stew, especially if you know people come to your restaurant to specifically try your raw crab.Warning: Any size combo, whether S, M, or L, all combos only comes with 1 small crab per flavor. That's bogus and definitely not worth the price. Had I known, I would've just ordered a la carte.

130,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Otium,"I was quite disappointed in the brunch service. First during brunch it is counter service, which you order at a cashier before getting a number and finding a seat.  Well after getting part of my order I was informed they did not have the Stout Pancakes, which I had ordered. Granted it was not on the menu but after I heard the couple in front of me  successfully order them I ordered them as well. Not sure why they didn't address this with me when they brought our the first part of my order, the bacon and bread with butter.When they were looking into the posssible price adjustment for the French toast vs the pancakes they tried to tell me the French toast was more expensive (per their computer) at $24 than the pancakes at $17 and saying they wouldn't charge me the up charge. Well the French Toast on the menu is actually listed as $14. I'm glad I had pics of the menu and a copy of my original e-receipt and after showing it to them they credited me the difference. Weird thing is when they gave me the corrected receipt the French toast rang up as $14. Is it dishonesty or just an honest mistake?The food was good but not amazing.  At the price point for brunch ($50 after tax & tip), it should have been table service with better service over all. Little things like a refill of water you have to get yourself from a community pitcher.  Also to note there is an additional 5% service charge on the bill aside from the gratuity.If this is the service for brunch I can't fathom what it would be like for dinner.

130,2023-09-14,2023-09-17,Otium,"Just had dinner at the Otium for the first time and it was an amazing experience. The restaurant features a very rustic and cozy industrial look and I personally loved the lighting of the place. The fireplace in the waiting area before you get seated was a nice touch as well.The food was great as well but there were definitely certain items on the menu that were better than others. For example, I personally wouldn't recommend the duck neck appetizer which we ordered. There was barely any meat on it and it was subpar overall. I would however highly recommend the beef tartare, and lightly recommend the soft shell shrimp as it was good but didn't live up to my expectations. I would say overall the appetizer menu could be a bit better.As for the main items, the gnocchi was phenomenal and some of the best we've had and the duck breast was very hearty and delicious. We have no complaints there.The drinks we had were good, I would recommend the Otium and more so the teatime gimlet if you want more of a refreshing drink.The service was where the Otium really shined. Between the pacing of the appetizers and entrees coming out, the attentiveness of our wonderful waiter who constantly switched out our dirty plates and provided warm towel wipes, and the overall care from staff I was deeply impressed.

The ambience is really nice and modern. The kitchen is wide open so you can see everything being prepared. The fridges have glass doors so you can see the meats hanging in there. The fresh focaccia and desserts are in a display counter by the register. The bar area has fresh ingredients all lined up. Normally you would grab a menu and order at the register before sitting, however they let us sit and took our order at the table.   I opted for the burger. Note that it comes diced pickled peppers which give it a really nice subtle kick...not spicy at all for those sensitive to spicy foods.  This was a really solid burger. I  would order it again. The fries however were not that impressive...kinda basic. I expected more from a $26 burger. Other than that, I got to try one of their 3 freshly baked foccacia breads. The potato focaccia was equally as amazing as the burger.

Even the edamame appetizer was $10.Our main dishes were also tasty but the prices were off again. $16 for a plate of stir-fry veggies and shrimp without rice. The Kra Pow was around $13 for a smaller portion with rice.Did the prices break the bank? Absolutely not. However, I feel as though the food and prices did not match up.

I opted for the chicken tenders with my waffles - and the chicken itself was amazing I got medium+, thank you to the cashier for putting me on the secret heat level because I was contemplating between medium & hot and it was amazing. The waffles tasted like cheap hotel self serve making waffles I did not enjoy. The fries were kinda all crunch, there was no potato on the inside. And the Mac and cheese needed a lot more seasoning.

Staff were super smiley and offered us some really cute pins and postcards while we had our orders taken.There is no interior seating, but the restaurant is situated in a little food hall of sorts with lots of little shops to check out if you can get a friend to wait in line. There's some seating outside the restaurant, but it can get full pretty quickly.I ordered the chicken and waffles medium hot for $16. Took around 15 minutes which was surprising considering the line. Tenders (3) were sizable and came with waffles, butter, and syrup. I think they use a drier spice rub, so I recommend getting the dipping sauce on the side for an extra charge.

You stand in line the waiter calls you on at a time to the booth to place your order then you wait out front.It's located in the heart of Chinatown so as you can imagine parking is nonexistent or metered. So be mindful of that.I ordered the Sando in medium and I have a high tolerance to spicy but mannnnn it was spicy! My friend got the tenders and she was equally dying with the medium spice level lol it was like burning but i also couldn't stop eating it. What I found annoying and the reason for 4/5 stars is everything is sold separately.

I was tempted to get the spiciest sandwich but got a mild sando to be safe. I could've probably handled a hotter sandwich but it was still good. The chicken was crunchy but juicy and there was a really nice depth of flavor because of the spices.  The sandwich is also a moderate size.There wasn't much space to sit besides a bench outside the shop.

I got the borscht, syrnyky (pancakes) with berries and custard, and the pelmeni chicken dumplings.I loved the comforting, earthy taste of the borscht. I'm a big fan of dill, which I believe it's an underrated herb, and it really shined in this dish. It came with some bread, slices of pork, and a side of sour cream. I really thought this was just really well done.The pancakes were great. There is almost a tart flavor to it and love the texture and the mix of flavors from the custard and berries.I'm a big fan of dumplings in any culture. The pelmeni were structurally sound and had great flavor.

Most of the food contains milk (cheese of some sort or sour cream). My Russian friends explain that is how you should enjoy home cooking. Hence, the reason it's not a five start is that it didn't match my flavor profile. But, when I got through the butter (I avoided the cheese and cream) I found fantastic flavors in the food.

Not too sweet, either.-- Medovik (10/10): I know it isn't Ukrainian, but I couldn't resist ordering this. I LOVE medovik, and ""Mom, Please"" did it so well: soft, slightly spongey layers with naturally-sweet honey and cream. I could eat slices of them!-- Potato varenyky (9.5/10): I bought them frozen and cooked them at home. So good!

Not it for me.This dish was served with sour cream which I dig, but I got the idea that that may be traditional which I respect. Just not for me.The Borscht, was probably the best thing we had out of the three, but even then it was pretty plain tasting and the meat was tough. I'm usually a huge fane of simple soups - it wasn't bad it was just lacking some kind of flavor... but what I did like about it was how it was simplified dish. Almost like a birria but stripped down.Also served with sour creamAnd for the Cherry Vareniky - idk - the texture of the encasing was a bit rubber and there just wasn't a rush of strong flavors.I was a bit sad because this place had ingredients mixed together that I had yet to see some in that way but when we got to it it just didn't hit.I appreciate being exposed to a different cultures food tho - I would want to try it out again but, I probably won't because of the atmosphere.","13151 Fountain Park Dr Playa Vista, CA 90094",4.8,108,"Pizza, Ukrainian, Breakfast & Brunch",$$,positive,1982,0.107,0.072,0.821,0.9514,0.975859987929994,0.9285714285714282,"['place', 'outside', 'small', 'quaint', 'feels', 'family', 'oriented', 'would', 'say', 'lot', 'clients', 'large', 'groups', 'families', 'diverse', 'clientele', 'seems', 'family', 'owned', 'plus', 'clientele', 'staff', 'came', 'bit', 'rude', 'rushed', 'cold', 'partner', 'felt', 'like', 'looked', 'oddly', 'ton', 'nonetheless', 'uncommon', 'thing', 'usually', 'care', 'felt', 'bit', 'food', 'pretty', 'underwhelming', 'tried', 'everything', 'menu', 'perhaps', 'ordered', 'something', 'work', 'however', 'hurried', 'chair', 'mind', 'come', 'hour', 'closing', 'however', 'worked', 'food', 'get', 'still', 'warm', 'hello', 'eye', 'contact', 'would', 'got', 'borscht', 'cherry', 'vareniky', 'chicken', 'came', 'cold', 'sure', 'supposed', 'served', 'like', 'crapes', 'chicken', 'hot', 'texture', 'felt', 'reheated', 'fresh', 'temperature', 'felt', 'hotter', 'areas', 'dish', 'served', 'sour', 'cream', 'dig', 'got', 'idea', 'may', 'traditional', 'respect', 'borscht', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'three', 'even', 'pretty', 'plain', 'tasting', 'meat', 'tough', 'usually', 'huge', 'fane', 'simple', 'soups', 'bad', 'lacking', 'kind', 'flavor', 'like', 'simplified', 'dish', 'almost', 'like', 'birria', 'stripped', 'served', 'sour', 'creamand', 'cherry', 'vareniky', 'idk', 'texture', 'encasing', 'bit', 'rubber', 'rush', 'strong', 'bit', 'sad', 'place', 'ingredients', 'mixed', 'together', 'yet', 'see', 'way', 'got', 'appreciate', 'exposed', 'different', 'cultures', 'food', 'tho', 'would', 'want', 'try', 'probably', 'wo', 'atmosphere']"

I'm used to thick slices but this place slices the meat super thin, which was pretty interesting. We also ordered 청국장 (fermented soy bean paste) soup. Smell can be tough to handle if you are not used to old school traditional Korean food, but I personally really enjoyed it. Service was also great too. They have a button on the table that you can press whenever you need something.I think the highlight was their muk gul lee, which is traditional Korean rice wine.

These were tasty overall but I wanted a bit more browning/crispness on the wrap and it needed a touch more hoisin sauce inside. 7.5/10Wood ear mushrooms: these were unfortunately a little lacking in flavor. Needed a bit more saltiness so it tasted a bit bland. 6/10Shrimp wontons: even though I got these to go, the wrappers still held up and the shrimp inside was still juicy and had a nice bite. The sauce was tangy and had great flavor. 8.5/10Dan Dan noodles: these were bland and I was disappointed. I tasted the sesame but found it overall lacking in flavor. It was definitely lacking in saltiness and umami. 6/10Overall there are some tasty items here, but some not so much. I wanted to like this place a lot more since I live so close by.

142,2023-09-15,2023-09-17,Pine & Crane DTLA,"Stopped by for lunch with my dad and immediately loved the ambience-- such a cute and cozy outdoor courtyard with lots of lovely greenery. We came on a relatively quiet day, too, so food came out quickly and service was efficient. To my surprise everything here is extremely affordable, cheap, even!Regrettably, after seeing the food other people got, we did not order any appetizers. I got the Dan Dan noodles which were only $11 and definitely worth more! The noodles were nice chewy texture, and the sauce was smooth, garlicky, slightly spicy and sweet. The peanuts added a great crunch, and the cucumbers provided refreshment and perfect combination with the peanut sauce. I would have liked some more veggies in this dish because it was overall a bit rich; I make a similar dish at home with shredded carrots and bok choy which I think would have made good additions.My dad's wonton soup broth was clean and clear, yet quite flavorful. I enjoyed it in today's cool weather.We finished the meal with the traditional shaved ice with grass jelly (my favorite), little taro and sweet potato rice cakes, red bean, and boba! As a self-proclaimed boba connoisseur I was actually quite impressed with the balls and I bet they have an amazing bobarista in the back! The ice itself was way too sweet for me. As for the texture, it was a bit icy (I'm not sure if Taiwanese shaved ice is supposed to be that way) and not silky soft like Korean bingsu. The portion was HUGE-- definitely could have been shared by 4-5 people.I'm glad I finally got to try Pine + Crane-- great ambiance, great taste and even better prices.

142,2023-09-12,2023-09-17,Pine & Crane DTLA,"Wow, I really hate to do this but I had one of the worst experiences today at Pine and Crane. Came in expecting to get breakfast, granted I showed up at 11 which is when breakfast service ends and I was told breakfast was no longer being served. After I place my order for Dan Dan Noodles I overheard the manager offer another customer breakfast, didn't make a big deal out of it just sat and waited for my food. My order came out a couple of minutes later so one star for fast service (mind you they gave me no utensils, no napkins, no condiments) but I live literally next door and when I tasted my noodles I'm not lying when I say these noodles were literally still slightly refrigerated/lukewarm. So I do what any normal person would do and went back and asked for another order which they politely agreed to.However, when my food came out the manager asked me if I had ever had the noodles before, to which I replied yes I have. Then she proceeded to try to justify that the noodles are quoted a 10 minute ticket time but that they typically take 2-3 minutes to cook, to which I replied well I don't understand how that applies to this situation because I walked in and ordered to-go and received my food right away. She went on to try to explain that maybe between the time the food was packed and when I ate it got cold. Yet I've had fast food stay hotter over a longer period of time. I explained to her that food should always be served hot, bottom line. She then called me aggressive and hostile, and I said sure I am a little upset because of the aforementioned experience with breakfast as she kept saying ""yeah"" ""uh-huh"" in a very condescending tone.On top of that there was a filthy terry towel in plain sight where they place everyone's to go orders, which I made her aware of and I pointed out how gross and dirty all her furniture was, which she didn't like at all. Her workers then started to harass me and tell me I was being rude. So I apologized and took accountability for my behavior and asked her to do the same about her condescending tone, and she literally told me it was ""in response to my behavior"".Again. WOW.Maybe I was just hangry, but this place has taken a complete nosedive, and I'm pretty sure like I'm most cases it's due to poor management.

The pan fried pork buns were not as juicy as other ones I've tried. I was expecting a lot of hot soup to pour out as a I nibble a piece of the dumpling. The wok tossed eggplant and basil dish was a bit better. It was some good flavors, but I can tell that the eggplant was not soaked enough longer to absorb flavors. Some aspects of the eggplant was blander than other parts. The beef roll was actually the one I was most excited for because I have been craving for it. It was the worse ones I've tried because there is a high cucumber to beef ratio so it felt more like a cucumber roll than a beef roll.The service is pretty good and the ambiance of the place is just like any DTLA establishment.

It was cold, about half popcorn and half Parmesan cheese...just piles of cheese. Weird, and not especially appetizing.Entrees: Mac and cheese - SO MUCH nutmeg. Not terrible if you like nutmeg, but weird. Seriously, SO MUCH.Blue cheese salad - a strange combination of toppings and a big pile of very weedy arugula with minimal dressing. Not bad, just eh.Jalapeño soup - it's not potato soup, it's a bowl of cream with added flavors and 2 small chunks of potato. The flavor was good, but it was really just like eating a bowl of flavored heavy cream.Dessert: churro waffle - I didn't think this could be messed up, but I was wrong. It seems like the waffles are SOAKED in a very sweet maple syrup, then cooked and covered in cinnamon and sugar. Daughter and I both thought they had a very strange flavor, we left more than half untouched.Out of coffee...no espresso and no coffee of any sort.

There was a nice ""Happy Anniversary"" card that they gave us upon being seated at the table. Waiter service was professional and knowledgeable. We ordered a lot of food since we wanted to try everything!- Prime Rib: Huge portion (18 oz); prepared medium with a loaded baked potato. Tender and flavorful. (9/10)- Rib Eye Steak: The BEST rib eye I have ever eaten! I would just go back for this steak alone! It was perfectly grilled on their 100-year old grill and you can taste the oak wood (or whatever wood they use in the grilling process). If you're a steak eater, definitely get the rib eye! (10/10)- Boneless Garlic Half Chicken: Very moist and juicy chicken. Garlic was perfect and not overpowering. Perfect for non-red meat eaters! (9/10)- Caesar salad: Lightly but perfectly dressed caesar salad; they will split it for you (no charge) if you're sharing. (7/10)- Truffled Mac and cheese: Very cheesy and creamy! (10/10)- Potatoes Au Gratin: Very creamy and potatoes are perfectly soft! (10/10)- Apple cobbler with scoop of vanilla ice cream- the perfect end to a fabulous dinner! (10/10)Drinks are strong (Apple Martini and Moscow Mule)! Metered parking on the side streets (you may need to drive around a few times!).

146,2023-08-15,2023-09-17,Here's Looking At You,"The food and drinks were really good, but the portions? Not so much. I understand that it's a shared small-plates restaurant, but it breaks my heart a little to pay $28 for really thinly sliced hamachi on a plate the size of my hand.I came here mainly for the duck liver and steak tartare, and both were on point with the seasoning and flavors.- Steak tartare: The spices in this gave the dish an extra crispy kick to it that tartares usually miss out on, which was really nice. The steak itself was really soft and really easy to eat by the spoonful and spreading it on the bread, which was also really good.- Duck liver with chips: Their newest iteration (no longer with bread). I really liked the coconut caramel glaze they put on top, but I wish there was more duck liver so that I don't have to skimp when I'm spreading it on the chips.- Tsukune: A little less seasoned and a little more bouncy/chewy (like fish balls) than I would have liked.- Hamachi: The flavors didn't really meld together for some reason, and I could only taste the hamachi even though it was seasoned with fresh herbs, cucumbers, and aguachile.The cocktails matched up with the better food items really well:- Ratio Me 1:1: The melon foam was slightly too sweet, and needed the drink to balance it out. It was really good still.- That Sh*t Bussin': This tasted like Thai coconut curry in a good way. A tiny bit spiced, coconutty, and satisfyingly savory while still sweet.A note about pacing: I was slightly disappointed that the tsukune came out 1 minute after the steak tartare, so there was a sacrifice in taste when we ate the room-temperature tsukune since we wanted to eat the tartare with the bread when it was still warm and crispy. Maybe I'm being a little picky, but I wanted to taste everything at it's best.A lot of other reviewers would agree by saying that the portions are really small, and I would suggest the restaurant to take in the feedback since their menu changes daily, meaning that things can change based off of customer feedback. Their servers are really nice, but I wish their small business would take in the feedback that I've been seeing quite consistently across reviewers.","3901 W 6th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.0,587,"American (New), Cocktail Bars",$$$,positive,2182,0.151,0.016,0.833,0.9956,0.9980889157111245,0.35714285714285704,"['food', 'drinks', 'really', 'good', 'portions', 'much', 'understand', 'shared', 'restaurant', 'breaks', 'heart', 'little', 'pay', 'really', 'thinly', 'sliced', 'hamachi', 'plate', 'size', 'came', 'mainly', 'duck', 'liver', 'steak', 'tartare', 'point', 'seasoning', 'steak', 'tartare', 'spices', 'gave', 'dish', 'extra', 'crispy', 'kick', 'tartares', 'usually', 'miss', 'really', 'nice', 'steak', 'really', 'soft', 'really', 'easy', 'eat', 'spoonful', 'spreading', 'bread', 'also', 'really', 'duck', 'liver', 'chips', 'newest', 'iteration', 'longer', 'bread', 'really', 'liked', 'coconut', 'caramel', 'glaze', 'put', 'top', 'wish', 'duck', 'liver', 'skimp', 'spreading', 'tsukune', 'little', 'less', 'seasoned', 'little', 'like', 'fish', 'balls', 'would', 'hamachi', 'flavors', 'really', 'meld', 'together', 'reason', 'could', 'taste', 'hamachi', 'even', 'though', 'seasoned', 'fresh', 'herbs', 'cucumbers', 'cocktails', 'matched', 'better', 'food', 'items', 'really', 'well', 'ratio', 'melon', 'foam', 'slightly', 'sweet', 'needed', 'drink', 'balance', 'really', 'good', 'sh', 'bussin', 'tasted', 'like', 'thai', 'coconut', 'curry', 'good', 'way', 'tiny', 'bit', 'spiced', 'coconutty', 'satisfyingly', 'savory', 'still', 'note', 'pacing', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'tsukune', 'came', 'minute', 'steak', 'tartare', 'sacrifice', 'taste', 'ate', 'tsukune', 'since', 'wanted', 'eat', 'tartare', 'bread', 'still', 'warm', 'crispy', 'maybe', 'little', 'picky', 'wanted', 'taste', 'everything', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'would', 'agree', 'saying', 'portions', 'really', 'small', 'would', 'suggest', 'restaurant', 'take', 'feedback', 'since', 'menu', 'changes', 'daily', 'meaning', 'things', 'change', 'based', 'customer', 'feedback', 'servers', 'really', 'nice', 'wish', 'small', 'business', 'would', 'take', 'feedback', 'seeing', 'quite', 'consistently', 'across', 'reviewers']"

The move top was nice, surrounded by many hedges, and to be expected many people over a typical Los Angeles scene. Although it seem like it could be a nice place to grab a drink at, The food was not as good as I expected it to be in pricey. The tuna tartare was probably the best thing on the limited menu, price at $38. They have a limited selection of pizza. You can order at the rooftop as well that are not listed on the menu, and tonight they had a lemon pizza. It was different and tasty, lemon, slightly overpowering, but the pizza was burnt, and there were some parts of it you really couldn't eat. We ordered one of the focaccias as well, and it was way too salty, and possibly a little too oily, although it was fluffy. Lastly, we ordered the Arancini, just be sure to know it has ham in it, which we didn't realize. It's funny for such a nice place that at the bottom of the Arancini plate they put almost Pizza Hut Parmesan sprinkles. The music was loud, rap music, and as much as I love rap music, it didn't really seem to go with the place and almost made it seem like the place was trying to hard. At max, I would return here for a drink, but I was otherwise unimpressed, and didn't see the hype compared to all the other great places LA has to offer.

155,2023-09-03,2023-09-17,Rosaline,"Rosaline is fairly energy-filled two-room restaurant that generally boasts different vibes depending on whether you are dining inside or in their inside garden. I usually prefer the garden although inside you can watch the kitchen do their magic. Having said that, if you join Rosaline for a meal be prepared to be sitting as close t your fellow diners as you can imagine, and participate in side bar conversations around you as they get louder and louder with the drinks progressing.I love their bar but find their cocktails to be unimaginative and bland. Even classic cocktails are not properly represented so I prefer to skip them.Food-wise, given the Peruvian theme of the restaurant there are tons of ceviches. Some are nice, but the ceviche crocante for example is pretty poor and delivered like a surrealist painting where the artist dropped a bunch of ingredients otherwise intended for different appetizers on a large plate. The dressing and zest in it was also under- and over-powering at the same time. I also disliked the coquettes but mostly because of their generalized unseasonedness.The octopus - despite traditionally a favorite dish of mine, here probably wins the spot of worst-in-town. It was overcooked but not in a chewy way; rather, it was an extra dose mushy. The tentacle had similar texture to Haribo gummy bears, so we left 2/3 of it.The scallops were probably the best dish of the bunch, and I thought the toasted quinoa on top with the sauce worked really well. Though again as before, they were a bit overcooked as well.In the end, while I have at previous visits enjoyed the family style paella, I would probably stop going to Rosaline. I had quite the underwhelming experience, service, and ended up getting a check with 20% tip automatically added, so maybe that's why service is a bit low-effort type.","8479 Melrose Ave West Hollywood, CA 90069",3.9,1131,"Peruvian, Cocktail Bars",$$$,positive,1835,0.115,0.042,0.843,0.9744,0.9874270770468719,0.2857142857142856,"['rosaline', 'fairly', 'restaurant', 'generally', 'boasts', 'different', 'vibes', 'depending', 'whether', 'dining', 'inside', 'inside', 'garden', 'usually', 'prefer', 'garden', 'although', 'inside', 'watch', 'kitchen', 'magic', 'said', 'join', 'rosaline', 'meal', 'prepared', 'sitting', 'close', 'fellow', 'diners', 'imagine', 'participate', 'side', 'bar', 'conversations', 'around', 'get', 'louder', 'louder', 'drinks', 'love', 'bar', 'find', 'cocktails', 'unimaginative', 'bland', 'even', 'classic', 'cocktails', 'properly', 'represented', 'prefer', 'skip', 'given', 'peruvian', 'theme', 'restaurant', 'tons', 'ceviches', 'nice', 'ceviche', 'crocante', 'example', 'pretty', 'poor', 'delivered', 'like', 'surrealist', 'painting', 'artist', 'dropped', 'bunch', 'ingredients', 'otherwise', 'intended', 'different', 'appetizers', 'large', 'plate', 'dressing', 'zest', 'also', 'time', 'also', 'disliked', 'coquettes', 'mostly', 'generalized', 'octopus', 'despite', 'traditionally', 'favorite', 'dish', 'mine', 'probably', 'wins', 'spot', 'overcooked', 'chewy', 'way', 'rather', 'extra', 'dose', 'mushy', 'tentacle', 'similar', 'texture', 'haribo', 'gummy', 'bears', 'left', 'scallops', 'probably', 'best', 'dish', 'bunch', 'thought', 'toasted', 'quinoa', 'top', 'sauce', 'worked', 'really', 'well', 'though', 'bit', 'overcooked', 'end', 'previous', 'visits', 'enjoyed', 'family', 'style', 'paella', 'would', 'probably', 'stop', 'going', 'rosaline', 'quite', 'underwhelming', 'experience', 'service', 'ended', 'getting', 'check', 'tip', 'automatically', 'added', 'maybe', 'service', 'bit', 'type']"

I was very excited for the chaufa paella and greatly disappointed when I got to experience it. Presentation was great, service was good, this dish was so Smokey in flavor I thought I was eating campfire tinder. I understand that one of the ingredients on it was bagoong, it's a fermented fish paste... our dish must have been lathered in it. O don't mind a little bit of Smokey flavor in my meals, but that was all we were able to taste. I almost always leave a plate clean, and if I don't leave it clean, I take the rest to go. Left more than half of this plate, I didn't take anymore home and expressed to our waitress it was so insanely Smokey it was inedible for both my partner and I. For a $49 dish I thought it was insulting, let alone the lack of care and attention when asked about the dish and informed our waitress that it was insanely smokey and rough on the palate. This occurred Friday 8/26 and our reservation was for 6:30pm, Rosaline was not busy by this time.The drinks were good, the paiche (jungle trout) was pretty good, and the atmosphere was lovely... I enjoyed basking under all the plants.

158,2023-09-10,2023-09-17,Woo Hyang Woo,"Woo Hyang Woo was an unanticipated delicious surprise!My friends and I came back from a music festival and we were strolling through Koreatown looking for KBBQ. However it was already late night nearing midnight, and many KBBQ places couldn't serve us due to the time. Eventually we walked into Woo Hyang Woo and they were still accepting late walk-ins! We were a party of 9, but even with a large group they were able to get us seated quickly and we ended up getting a whole room to ourselves which felt like special treatment!My group split into two different tables. For my table we ordered one of the Woo Hyang Woo Combo D which came with Prime Beef Brisket, Prime Boneless Short Ribs, Prime Boneless Ribeye, and we chose to get the Prime Beef Bulgogi. All the meats were delicious and I liked the banchan that was offered. I think the other table group ordered 2 different combos as well.The service here was also some of the best I've experience in all of Koreatown. The young guy who sat us here had a likeable personality and felt relatable. We also mentioned about the promotion of leaving a yelp review for free soju, and in turn he gave us two free soju bottles for each table. And even though we were trying to cook the KBBQ meats ourselves, the staff offered to do it for us which was nice.All in all, I really like Woo Hyang Woo. I've only tried a couple of KBBQs in Koreatown, but so far this one is my favourite for the time being. I will say that this place can end up a little pricey, but honestly it was worth it.","3429 W 6th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.6,1053,"Korean, Barbeque, Bars",$$$,positive,1532,0.244,0.0,0.756,0.9976,0.9990947495473749,0.7857142857142853,"['woo', 'hyang', 'woo', 'unanticipated', 'delicious', 'surprise', 'friends', 'came', 'back', 'music', 'festival', 'strolling', 'koreatown', 'looking', 'kbbq', 'however', 'already', 'late', 'night', 'nearing', 'midnight', 'many', 'kbbq', 'places', 'could', 'serve', 'us', 'due', 'time', 'eventually', 'walked', 'woo', 'hyang', 'woo', 'still', 'accepting', 'late', 'party', 'even', 'large', 'group', 'able', 'get', 'us', 'seated', 'quickly', 'ended', 'getting', 'whole', 'room', 'felt', 'like', 'special', 'treatment', 'group', 'split', 'two', 'different', 'tables', 'table', 'ordered', 'one', 'woo', 'hyang', 'woo', 'combo', 'came', 'prime', 'beef', 'brisket', 'prime', 'boneless', 'short', 'ribs', 'prime', 'boneless', 'ribeye', 'chose', 'get', 'prime', 'beef', 'bulgogi', 'meats', 'delicious', 'liked', 'banchan', 'offered', 'think', 'table', 'group', 'ordered', 'different', 'combos', 'service', 'also', 'best', 'experience', 'koreatown', 'young', 'guy', 'sat', 'us', 'likeable', 'personality', 'felt', 'relatable', 'also', 'mentioned', 'promotion', 'leaving', 'yelp', 'review', 'free', 'soju', 'turn', 'gave', 'us', 'two', 'free', 'soju', 'bottles', 'table', 'even', 'though', 'trying', 'cook', 'kbbq', 'meats', 'staff', 'offered', 'us', 'really', 'like', 'woo', 'hyang', 'woo', 'tried', 'couple', 'kbbqs', 'koreatown', 'far', 'one', 'favourite', 'time', 'say', 'place', 'end', 'little', 'pricey', 'honestly', 'worth']"

A few of the sides were really solid too. The protein dishes are more substantial and thereby best to go in groups and share. Be prepared to spend a bit. Recommend sitting in the patio!Details: we had a group of 6 guys and details below on what we ordered. We had a ton of leftovers.. for sure only needed one of the protein dishes, but still happy we tried both. If you had to do one, try the short rib if it's your first time. Potatoes and tomatoes were great. Bings were good, just a bit pricey for what it is. Oysters were very average.1) short rib (pre-order needed): definitely the star of the show! Smoked bone in, carved table side. Great flavor and quality bbq. Leftover carvings were used to then make fried rice. Accoutrements were pretty average. Expensive at $235, but does feed 4-5. Recommend for a special occasion if it's your first time!2) smoked bo ssam (pork shoulder): really great flavor, smokey and sweet. To me it was like high quality pulled pork with asian inspired flavors. Good for sharing.3) crispy potatoes: perfect pairing for the proteins to add some carbs. We ordered two of these4) heirloom tomatoes: super fresh and sweet, balanced perfectly with the sesame vinaigrette. They served this dish as appetizer, would have preferred to have this with the meat to help cut the fat a bit.5) bings: had the butter/honey and the ricotta/compote. Really really good.. freshly griddled bing paired and the dips were both really good. Assuming u are already there to splurge, I'd say get two to try.6) oysters: while fresh, nothing really stood out. Would have expected maybe a bit more at $26 for half dozen.All in all, recommend trying if you haven't been and go in a group!","1725 Naud St Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.2,1363,"American (New), Asian Fusion, Korean",$$$,positive,1845,0.286,0.007,0.707,0.9988,0.9996982498491249,0.5,"['finally', 'opportunity', 'try', 'majordomo', 'summary', 'good', 'larger', 'group', 'format', 'dining', 'focused', 'menu', 'anchored', 'really', 'protein', 'dishes', 'sides', 'really', 'solid', 'protein', 'dishes', 'substantial', 'thereby', 'best', 'go', 'groups', 'share', 'prepared', 'spend', 'bit', 'recommend', 'sitting', 'patio', 'details', 'group', 'guys', 'details', 'ordered', 'ton', 'leftovers', 'sure', 'needed', 'one', 'protein', 'dishes', 'still', 'happy', 'tried', 'one', 'try', 'short', 'rib', 'first', 'time', 'potatoes', 'tomatoes', 'great', 'bings', 'good', 'bit', 'pricey', 'oysters', 'short', 'rib', 'needed', 'definitely', 'star', 'show', 'smoked', 'bone', 'carved', 'table', 'side', 'great', 'flavor', 'quality', 'bbq', 'leftover', 'carvings', 'used', 'make', 'fried', 'rice', 'accoutrements', 'pretty', 'average', 'expensive', 'feed', 'recommend', 'special', 'occasion', 'first', 'time', 'smoked', 'bo', 'ssam', 'pork', 'shoulder', 'really', 'great', 'flavor', 'smokey', 'sweet', 'like', 'high', 'quality', 'pulled', 'pork', 'asian', 'inspired', 'flavors', 'good', 'crispy', 'potatoes', 'perfect', 'pairing', 'proteins', 'add', 'carbs', 'ordered', 'two', 'heirloom', 'tomatoes', 'super', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'balanced', 'perfectly', 'sesame', 'vinaigrette', 'served', 'dish', 'appetizer', 'would', 'preferred', 'meat', 'help', 'cut', 'fat', 'bings', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'freshly', 'griddled', 'bing', 'paired', 'dips', 'really', 'good', 'assuming', 'u', 'already', 'splurge', 'say', 'get', 'two', 'oysters', 'fresh', 'nothing', 'really', 'stood', 'would', 'expected', 'maybe', 'bit', 'half', 'recommend', 'trying', 'go', 'group']"

159,2023-08-24,2023-09-17,Majordomo,"I've generally had a decent experience at Majordomo for many reasons. I have been there a total of three times and I can tell one thing for sure is the consistency in the good service and ambiance. Everybody is very friendly and accommodating. I remember arriving early my first time and I was given a nice seat m at the bar where I ordered one of my favorite lemon ginger shiso mocktails before my party arrived.I also remember every one of our servers being very knowledgeable about the menu and being helpful with what to choose in terms of cocktails, appetizers, entrées, and desserts. The ambience from the open floor plan makes it very interactive and lively with all the tables filled with people, and sometimes close enough where you can have conversations with people next to you. We remember talking to our neighbor and sharing ideas over which dessert to share and I found that to be super fun and memorable.A number of things stand out from the menu at Majordomo. Off the top of my head I can confidently say that the Bing bread (or Chinese flatbread) is one of the most unique types of bread I've ever tried. We have ordered it every time and it's never disappointed. It's very difficult to choose something other than the butter and truffle honey but I hope that one day I can muster up the courage to try the other sides it comes with.The mushroom fried rice is a delicious entree with a very cool presentation as the server cracks the crusted layer of the rice and mixes it in front of you. Very flavorful.We had a subpar experience last time when we ordered the wagyu steak and did not at all have real wagyu steak in front of us. It was one of the worst experiences we've had with steak before. The meat was extremely chewy - so much that we needed to cut them up into diced cubes to be able to enjoy them. It would have been a choking hazard had we tried to eat them in the slices that had arrived in. Horrible experience. We told the server who was very empathetic and relayed the message to the chef. We got our cocktails taken care of. We will never order it again which was a shame since the marination was delicious.I had been told multiple times by servers in my prior visits that the chickpea mac and cheese is their popular one. We decided to order it and it was actually just alright. Nothing to write home about.The kimchi pasta was a decent plate which was taken off their menu the last time. The fries and steak in my past visits were also much better.If you're looking for something decent, you won't be disappointed here.

Our server who was very nice and well mannered got my omelette order wrong. I had two bites of the omelette when I noticed that it was missing the mushrooms that I ordered to come with the omelette. No biggie I mentioned to my waitress and she said that she would bring the mushrooms on the side. I said no i prefer to have them cooked with the omelette. She said she would remove the order from check. I said please don't just make another one for me please and remove the one I got from my check. After about 10-15 minutes the correct omelette was brought to me. It was very good and delicious. After I ate half of my omelette with mushrooms i request for the check.The manager came by to ring up my check. I guess they must of misunderstood me because I noticed in my check that they charged me for two omelettes! I told the manager that they got my order wrong on the first omelette and requested to have them make another one. He said well you almost ate all of the first one so that is why I am charging you for that one as well. I told him I took two bites from the omelette plus the omelette there are European size. 3 big bites and the omelette is gone. He answered with a typical French attitude. He made a smirk and removed the first omelette from my charge. FYI they automatically charge 18% gratuity on your check. I told him if that I don't mind paying for the first omelette but I don't think it is fair. He said no it's fine . I went ahead and added to the extra tip for the omelette I ate in the beginning.

I ordered the octopus and it was good, the octopus had a nice bite and the potato purée paired really well with the octopus. For drinks I ordered the LA GIRL, it had vodka, cucumber, peach, aloe and lime, it was a refreshing treat. All cocktails started at $17 which is pretty standard for LA but not sure if it was worth that price!

162,2023-08-28,2023-09-17,The Rooftop at The Wayfarer Downtown LA,"Came for lunch and we were seated in a table that was barely covered. It was one of the hottest days this week too so it was quite warms and unpleasant. Another thing to note was that we did not have set server. So for the first 30 mins of being seated, we didn't have anyone come check on us and we're just cooking in the sun with no water. Eventually we waved down some other server and they came by to tell us they'll get our server.We then asked to move tables because ours wasn't cover and they were able to relocate us to the table under the plant canopy. One thing to note was that there wasn't much airflow so that area was quite stuffy. We then again, had to wave someone down to take our order because we didn't have a set server at the new table. It was quite unorganized and made the meal more uncomfortable and unwelcoming.After ordering, our food took a while to arrive maybe 30+ minutes. At the time the restaurant was quite empty as it was already 2PM. The dishes were interesting part of the chefs brunch. Portions are pretty small though, almost like tapas or for like 2 bites. They all had many ingredients which was interesting, some went well better than others. Half way through the meal, someone from our group wasn't feeling well so they needed to rest, luckily there was space but the staff rarely came over and when they did they approached us with a cold shoulder almost trying to kick us out and not offer any support to help. We stayed for a while until our friend felt better, and there was no one around us. When we did left on of the servers approached us very aggressively and spoke to us in a very condescending way. I understand the frustrating but there was definitely a nicer way to approach the situation.Food -- 7/10 small portions, a lot of different flavors some worked better than othersService -- 1/10 rude, non attentive, unapproachable, hostile toneAmbiance (daytime) -- 6/10 it was okay, there's an open roof, but a lot of plants blocking the view and tables are a bit cramped and music a bit too loud","813 Flower St Los Angeles, CA 90017",3.6,611,"American (New), Cocktail Bars, Tiki Bars",$$$,positive,2047,0.105,0.078,0.817,0.8409,0.9202876684771675,0.07142857142857148,"['came', 'lunch', 'seated', 'table', 'barely', 'covered', 'one', 'hottest', 'days', 'week', 'quite', 'warms', 'unpleasant', 'another', 'thing', 'note', 'set', 'server', 'first', 'mins', 'seated', 'anyone', 'come', 'check', 'us', 'cooking', 'sun', 'water', 'eventually', 'waved', 'server', 'came', 'tell', 'us', 'get', 'asked', 'move', 'tables', 'cover', 'able', 'relocate', 'us', 'table', 'plant', 'canopy', 'one', 'thing', 'note', 'much', 'airflow', 'area', 'quite', 'stuffy', 'wave', 'someone', 'take', 'order', 'set', 'server', 'new', 'table', 'quite', 'unorganized', 'made', 'meal', 'uncomfortable', 'ordering', 'food', 'took', 'arrive', 'maybe', 'minutes', 'time', 'restaurant', 'quite', 'empty', 'already', 'dishes', 'interesting', 'part', 'chefs', 'brunch', 'portions', 'pretty', 'small', 'though', 'almost', 'like', 'tapas', 'like', 'bites', 'many', 'ingredients', 'interesting', 'went', 'well', 'better', 'others', 'half', 'way', 'meal', 'someone', 'group', 'feeling', 'well', 'needed', 'rest', 'luckily', 'space', 'staff', 'rarely', 'came', 'approached', 'us', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'almost', 'trying', 'kick', 'us', 'offer', 'support', 'help', 'stayed', 'friend', 'felt', 'better', 'one', 'around', 'us', 'left', 'servers', 'approached', 'us', 'aggressively', 'spoke', 'us', 'condescending', 'way', 'understand', 'frustrating', 'definitely', 'nicer', 'way', 'approach', 'small', 'portions', 'lot', 'different', 'flavors', 'worked', 'better', 'othersservice', 'rude', 'non', 'attentive', 'unapproachable', 'hostile', 'toneambiance', 'daytime', 'okay', 'open', 'roof', 'lot', 'plants', 'blocking', 'view', 'tables', 'bit', 'cramped', 'music', 'bit', 'loud']"

164,2023-09-09,2023-09-17,Tlayuda L.A. Restaurant,"In the ever-echoing chambers of my mind, the eternal question reverberates, ""What the hell am I in the mood for?"" As I sift through the tapestry of tastes I've encountered, the sultry allure of Mexican beckons. Tacos from a street vendor? The hearty embrace of a burrito? Or perhaps the underrated charm of a torta? But then, a voice, dripping with sarcasm, chimes in, ""Sure, but which Mexico are you talking about?"" It's a gentle reminder of the vast culinary landscape of Mexico, divided into seven distinct regions: Norteño, Bajacaliforniano, Chipas, Jaliscense, Yucateco, Veracruzano, and Oaxaqueño. Each with its own heartbeat, its own soul. Today, my culinary compass pointed towards tlayudas - Oaxaca's misunderstood masterpiece, often dubbed the ""Oaxacan Pizza.""Tlayuda Los Angeles, a place where the art of tlayuda-making is revered, was my chosen sanctuary. I settled on their ""Tlayuda Supreme,"" a symphony of flavors on an expansive toasted corn tortilla canvas, adorned with bean puree, fresh greens, and a trinity of meats - Tasajo beef, cesina pork, and the fiery chorizo.But let's get one thing straight - calling this a pizza is like calling a Stradivarius a fiddle. It's closer in spirit to a tostada or an open-faced taco. The tlayuda I had was a revelation. A dish steeped in Oaxacan tradition, its foundation is a tortilla, crisped to perfection. It's then painted with refried black beans, layered with greens, and crowned with Oaxacan cheese and a medley of grilled meats. A splash of salsa, a sprinkle of fresh herbs, and you're on a journey. Some might fold it, letting the cheese melt in a warm embrace, while others, like me, prefer it open, in all its glory. And to wash it down? A gulp of mezcal or, in my case, a refreshing mint cucumber lemonade.So, the next time the siren song of Mexican food calls, ask yourself, ""Which corner of Mexico am I yearning for?"" Today, it was Oaxaqueño, with its tantalizing tlayuda. And the warmth of Tlayuda Los Angeles? It felt like coming home to a family I never knew I had.

During the summer, it can get really busy, but during normal times of the year, you can really feel The Canyon's ambiance in respect to this cafe. I came to this spot for brunch and we were seated quickly through their online waiting list which I think is very technologically efficient as it allowed for us to get in a walk around the beautiful neighborhood until our food was ready.My server was very kind throughout our meal and patiently came back to our table a few times until we were ready since it took us a bit to begin ordering. I ordered the Classic French Toast which had strawberries and powdered sugar on it in addition to a Nutella Iced Latte. I originally thought the portions for the french toast were a little small for the price, but it was surprisingly filling. I would definitely recommend this for a brunch meal. The Nutella flavored latte, however, I would not recommend as it did not taste like Nutella or hazelnut and rather not that pleasantly flavored at all. I did unfortunately feel like that purchase was a waste.At the end of the day, the external environment and internal ambiance makes this cafe worth a visit for a brunch meal, but one shouldn't expect the highest of food/drink quality.","2695 N Beachwood Dr Los Angeles, CA 90068",4.1,758,"American (New), Breakfast & Brunch",$$,positive,1303,0.146,0.053,0.801,0.9793,0.9898913699456849,0.4285714285714282,"['beachwood', 'cafe', 'feel', 'stop', 'right', 'time', 'summer', 'get', 'really', 'busy', 'normal', 'times', 'year', 'really', 'feel', 'canyon', 'ambiance', 'respect', 'cafe', 'came', 'spot', 'brunch', 'seated', 'quickly', 'online', 'waiting', 'list', 'think', 'technologically', 'efficient', 'allowed', 'us', 'get', 'walk', 'around', 'beautiful', 'neighborhood', 'food', 'server', 'kind', 'throughout', 'meal', 'patiently', 'came', 'back', 'table', 'times', 'ready', 'since', 'took', 'us', 'bit', 'begin', 'ordering', 'ordered', 'classic', 'french', 'toast', 'strawberries', 'powdered', 'sugar', 'addition', 'nutella', 'iced', 'latte', 'originally', 'thought', 'portions', 'french', 'toast', 'little', 'small', 'price', 'surprisingly', 'filling', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'brunch', 'meal', 'nutella', 'flavored', 'latte', 'however', 'would', 'recommend', 'taste', 'like', 'nutella', 'hazelnut', 'rather', 'pleasantly', 'flavored', 'unfortunately', 'feel', 'like', 'purchase', 'end', 'day', 'external', 'environment', 'internal', 'ambiance', 'makes', 'cafe', 'worth', 'visit', 'brunch', 'meal', 'one', 'expect', 'highest', 'quality']"

They have a large, free, parking lot in the back of the restaurant and we were able to find space there for a 10:30AM Sunday brunch. We got lucky with our arrival time so were able to be seated as soon as we arrived. Our server Jennifer G did a great job and was very attentive.As mentioned they have one of my favorite Eggs Benedicts' in LA. The hollandaise is seasoned well, the eggs were perfect, and they all sit on a Texas toast which really adds to the flavor and allows you to soak up the egg. We also order Caramel Lattes which I would highly recommend, the Avocado Toast as a share plate which was fantastic due to the labneh below the avocado, and also the Berry Pancakes, which were a hit as well.Overall one of my favorite breakfast spots in LA.

We were lured by the pictures of the deep dish pizza and promptly exited the freeway.The restaurant is smack-dab in the old downtown area of Echo Park. We requested a table and the host was kind enough to let us know it takes 50 minutes to get the pizza from the time of ordering on a Saturday night, so we could place an order at the to-go window and have it sent to our table.

We came on a Sunday night and maybe we were lucky but we were seated immediately.No complaints with service. Just as a tip, they take last call for deep dish pizzas early due to how long they take to cook so plan accordingly.Now to the food!Suppli - I was immediately flashed back to my time in Rome. The creamy risotto inside a perfectly fried shell. The mozzarella core was such a pleasant surprise.bonus - the marinara sauce on the side HAD to have been made in house. I particularly appreciated the slight acidity that makes this sauce unique.Calamari - your above average restaruant calamari. Enjoyable, crispy but a little salty for my taste.Traditional Deep Dish Pizza - before I say anything else, I enjoyed this pizza.  That being said, the crust is a lot thicker than more authentic Chicago style pizzas. Often times above said crust goes toppings and cheese, then a large heaping of sauce. Given the sauce, I was most excited for this. But because the crust was so thick, I felt that the other elements were not only out of order, but lacking in amount. I particularly questioned the choice of having one large patty of sausage placed atop the pizza because it would often slide off. It was delicious, just not comparable to Chicago.","1800 W Sunset Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90026",4.2,4682,Pizza,$$,positive,1358,0.154,0.022,0.823,0.9882,0.9943673305169985,0.5,"['first', 'foremost', 'homey', 'yet', 'intimate', 'atmosphere', 'perfect', 'date', 'night', 'hanging', 'friends', 'came', 'sunday', 'night', 'maybe', 'lucky', 'seated', 'complaints', 'service', 'tip', 'take', 'last', 'call', 'deep', 'dish', 'pizzas', 'early', 'due', 'long', 'take', 'cook', 'plan', 'food', 'suppli', 'immediately', 'flashed', 'back', 'time', 'rome', 'creamy', 'risotto', 'inside', 'perfectly', 'fried', 'shell', 'mozzarella', 'core', 'pleasant', 'marinara', 'sauce', 'side', 'made', 'house', 'particularly', 'appreciated', 'slight', 'acidity', 'makes', 'sauce', 'average', 'restaruant', 'calamari', 'enjoyable', 'crispy', 'little', 'salty', 'deep', 'dish', 'pizza', 'say', 'anything', 'else', 'enjoyed', 'pizza', 'said', 'crust', 'lot', 'thicker', 'authentic', 'chicago', 'style', 'pizzas', 'often', 'times', 'said', 'crust', 'goes', 'toppings', 'cheese', 'large', 'heaping', 'sauce', 'given', 'sauce', 'excited', 'crust', 'thick', 'felt', 'elements', 'order', 'lacking', 'amount', 'particularly', 'questioned', 'choice', 'one', 'large', 'patty', 'sausage', 'placed', 'atop', 'pizza', 'would', 'often', 'slide', 'delicious', 'comparable', 'chicago']"

I went about a month ago and then 2 days ago thinking that maybe a month ago they were just having a bad rush day but when I went 2 days ago, it was just as bad. I don't know if they changed the cooks or if it was busy so they didn't really focus on timing but it was not good at all. I got the salmon and shrimp plate. My salmon was beyond dry, ridiculously dry. I could tell as soon as I opened the container. The salmon was hard in certain pieces, it wasn't burnt but very very over cooked. The plating was very nice but it was difficult to eat the salmon because of the dryness and hard pieces. I've never had this issue except for the last 2xs that I visited here. And I always get the same thing and both times I was very disappointed.It's disheartening because I spend $100 there easily every time I go and I expect to get quality food for spending that amount every time. My husband and son also got a plate but chicken and steak. The chicken was just as dry as the salmon.I'm unclear what's going on the last few visits but I don't think I'll be returning any time soon. There are a few Hibachi restaurants around so I may have to try another spot from here on.I would recommend maybe try something small first instead of getting a plate because you don't want to spend a lot of money on something that's not cooked to perfection.","1045 S Hill St Los Angeles, CA 90015",3.9,390,"Steakhouses, Seafood, Teppanyaki",$$,negative,1442,0.05,0.132,0.817,-0.9756,0.006739086702876668,0.2857142857142856,"['come', 'probably', 'like', 'food', 'last', 'went', 'good', 'went', 'month', 'ago', 'days', 'ago', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'month', 'ago', 'bad', 'rush', 'day', 'went', 'days', 'ago', 'bad', 'know', 'changed', 'cooks', 'busy', 'really', 'focus', 'timing', 'good', 'got', 'salmon', 'shrimp', 'plate', 'salmon', 'beyond', 'dry', 'ridiculously', 'dry', 'could', 'tell', 'soon', 'opened', 'container', 'salmon', 'hard', 'certain', 'pieces', 'burnt', 'cooked', 'plating', 'nice', 'difficult', 'eat', 'salmon', 'dryness', 'hard', 'pieces', 'never', 'issue', 'except', 'last', 'visited', 'always', 'get', 'thing', 'times', 'disheartening', 'spend', 'easily', 'every', 'time', 'go', 'expect', 'get', 'quality', 'food', 'spending', 'amount', 'every', 'time', 'husband', 'son', 'also', 'got', 'plate', 'chicken', 'steak', 'chicken', 'dry', 'unclear', 'going', 'last', 'visits', 'think', 'returning', 'time', 'soon', 'hibachi', 'restaurants', 'around', 'may', 'try', 'another', 'spot', 'would', 'recommend', 'maybe', 'try', 'something', 'small', 'first', 'instead', 'getting', 'plate', 'want', 'spend', 'lot', 'money', 'something', 'cooked', 'perfection']"

The gelato was the best gelato i have ever had in my life - rich, creamy, with some bites being slightly salty from the egg yolk shaved on top.The in between dishes  such as the gnocchi, new york steak, and scallop were decent but all quite forgetable.

Service wise, nothing special- we got seated, no smiles, got introduced our dish, got our checks, and got thanked on the way out.Overall, it was an okay experience.I would come back but order individual dishes the next time!

I called ahead to get a reservation for 4, only to have us wait over 2 hours in the heat, on the sidewalk. We looked forward to trying their food, so we were as patient as we could be. Every time I checked in with the front hosts, I was met with poor attitude from the host/owner. Servers avoided eye contact with everyone and did not engage any inquiries - they did look overworked. Phrases like ""We're doing our best, but understand we don't have enough seats"" are acceptable enough, but what isn't acceptable is confirming a reservation they never intended to honor. When I confronted the host with this conflict, he angrily asked me what I'd like him to do, and I asked if we could be seated soon since we waited a long time. This request exasperated him - I understand the stress, but again, if he doubted he could seat us at all, he could've said so in the beginning when we first checked in, and rejected the reservation request over the phone even earlier - instead of telling me to show up on time and have our party wait for hours outside.

We were able to be seated within 5 minutes. Turnaround was quick, and initial impression gave that authentic vibe we were looking for. The restaurant smelled so good once we entered.Ordered the Chicken Pad Kee Mao, Shrimp Pad Thai,  the Spicy Clams, and Thai Tea.Spicy Clams was definitely the highlight of the meal, with an amazing sauce and generous portions of both clams. Would be great paired with some rice next time!The Pad Thai had the perfect balance of sweetness, countered by the limes. Next time I would try the beef, but the shrimp was a nice upgrade.Pad Kee Mao had a good sauce mix, with the spicy kick adding in a little to the dish. Not to mention, the eggs in the pad kee mao + pad thai were standouts :) (if i could get double portions of eggs i would 100% go for it)Overall, if you are looking for authentic thai food with no funny business, this is the place to go to.

178,2023-09-10,2023-09-17,Bottega Louie - WEHO,"I'm compelled to say, this is the worst breakfast I've ever had in ANY restaurant.  My dog & I pass by here often on our morning walks & I kept thinking ""One of these mornings"", we're gonna stop & have a pleasant outdoor breakfast. I got the ""pleasant outdoor"" part right, but the breakfast part was beyond the pale disappointing, almost annoying.  First, I'm absolutely sure none of the food was fresh. The ""breakfast potatoes"" looked like round black rocks & were almost as hard, & had some other soft, mushy types of vegetables mixed in. The sausage was dry & hard & the bacon, which I'd asked for very crisp, was like a soft, greasy sponge (even my dog wouldn't eat it) & the eggs, which I'd asked for medium well, we so undone, they ran ALL over the plate. None of it was hot in the meaningful sense of the word. I enjoy any fast-food restaurant breakfast much more.  At least the food is always fresh & hot & the price is within the range of common sense. In addition to the seriously overpriced food they serve, they add an additional 5% ""surcharge"" which they say is to mitigate inflation & other operating costs"" but make it clear that an ""employee gratuity"" is additional.  Restaurants keep getting away with this because a naive & gullible public gladly validates the old adage that ""A fool & his money are soon parted.""  I find this trend annoying & offensive &, I fear, it's only going to get worse as more & more people simply pay up without objection.  As for Bottega Louie. their other food & their pastries look good from the window, but my dog & I will never find out. BTW, I'm now considering adding a ""surcharge"" to all of my tenants' monthly rents to cover increasing operating costs.  Sounds fair to me.","8936 Santa Monica Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90069",4.1,740,"Bakeries, Desserts, Italian",$$$,positive,1725,0.137,0.125,0.738,0.6379,0.8181955340977671,0.4285714285714282,"['compelled', 'say', 'worst', 'breakfast', 'ever', 'restaurant', 'dog', 'pass', 'often', 'morning', 'walks', 'kept', 'thinking', 'one', 'mornings', 'gon', 'na', 'stop', 'pleasant', 'outdoor', 'breakfast', 'got', 'pleasant', 'outdoor', 'part', 'right', 'breakfast', 'part', 'beyond', 'pale', 'disappointing', 'almost', 'annoying', 'first', 'absolutely', 'sure', 'none', 'food', 'fresh', 'breakfast', 'potatoes', 'looked', 'like', 'round', 'black', 'rocks', 'almost', 'hard', 'soft', 'mushy', 'types', 'vegetables', 'mixed', 'sausage', 'dry', 'hard', 'bacon', 'asked', 'crisp', 'like', 'soft', 'greasy', 'sponge', 'even', 'dog', 'would', 'eat', 'eggs', 'asked', 'medium', 'well', 'undone', 'ran', 'plate', 'none', 'hot', 'meaningful', 'sense', 'word', 'enjoy', 'restaurant', 'breakfast', 'much', 'least', 'food', 'always', 'fresh', 'hot', 'price', 'within', 'range', 'common', 'sense', 'addition', 'seriously', 'overpriced', 'food', 'serve', 'add', 'additional', 'surcharge', 'say', 'mitigate', 'inflation', 'operating', 'costs', 'make', 'clear', 'employee', 'gratuity', 'additional', 'restaurants', 'keep', 'getting', 'away', 'naive', 'gullible', 'public', 'gladly', 'validates', 'old', 'adage', 'fool', 'money', 'soon', 'parted', 'find', 'trend', 'annoying', 'offensive', 'fear', 'going', 'get', 'worse', 'people', 'simply', 'pay', 'without', 'objection', 'bottega', 'louie', 'food', 'pastries', 'look', 'good', 'window', 'dog', 'never', 'find', 'btw', 'considering', 'adding', 'surcharge', 'tenants', 'monthly', 'rents', 'cover', 'increasing', 'operating', 'costs', 'sounds', 'fair']"

Let's begin by Saying earning a Michelin star is no ordinary occurrence. Having three Michelin stars makes you absolutely unique and extraordinary.You have earned the title and respect, because for you, it's about passion.You don't believe in cutting corners when it comes to the highest quality ingredients. You believe that if one must deliver the best experience and food quality it must be done right or you don't do it at all.My family and I had a wonderful experience at the museum corridor near Wilshire and La Brea. We used Yelp to search ramen restaurants in that area and Kazan populated first.Noodles really didn't become a stable food in Japan until the 1800s. If you truly want to taste an authentic Japanese ramen house you found the place, no need to fly to Tokyo anymore.Oh boy, what a wonderful experience. As you can see by the photographs the restaurant is a bit small but Gosh when it comes to the taste of the fresh soba thin noodles ,the distinctive flavors of the light broth, and to your tongue's desire you feel the tender texture of the chashu pork,. Now, you realized you are in Ramen's heaven.We ordered two Signature #1 dish, and one Lei ramen. Absolutely, delicious. Something I personally found interesting the design of the serving bowls. As you are being served you don't realized that the size portion of this soup is rather large, but it looks small.Trust me it's feels you-up because the bowl has a unique design that keeps a lot of the noodles at the bottom of the bowl.The restaurant is absolutely clean, the staff were friendly and professional.Last, this is a secret, if you want the best time to peacefully enjoy your meal and savor every ingredient come around 4pm. We parked at an adjacent parking structure next to the restaurant just pay the fee and relax.

Details so you can understand why it's such a big deal to me.I am beyond irritated and sick to my stomach...but they did refund me and were very apologetic and nice about it.PSA: If you do not eat meat and are excited about their vegetarian / vegan options, do not eat here; you will probably get sick. If you are a meat eater, 10/10 recommend and would give it 5 stars.If they didn't handle the situation properly, and if it weren't so good (pre sickness), I would've rated it 1. But because they handled it so well and the food is undeniably good, I had to give 3 stars.","1737 Silver Lake Blvd Ste 1 Los Angeles, CA 90026",4.5,604,"Thai, Asian Fusion",$$,negative,959,0.086,0.149,0.764,-0.9334,0.027962180647756983,0.7142857142857141,"['food', 'tastes', 'amazing', 'ordered', 'vegetarian', 'dish', 'meat', 'chicken', 'guess', 'either', 'pork', 'beef', 'literally', 'started', 'getting', 'sick', 'stomach', 'accidentally', 'eating', 'pescatarian', 'alternated', 'vegetarian', 'pescatarian', 'currently', 'eat', 'mostly', 'products', 'seafood', 'occasionally', 'times', 'month', 'details', 'understand', 'big', 'deal', 'beyond', 'irritated', 'sick', 'stomach', 'refund', 'apologetic', 'nice', 'eat', 'meat', 'excited', 'vegetarian', 'vegan', 'options', 'eat', 'probably', 'get', 'sick', 'meat', 'eater', 'recommend', 'would', 'give', 'handle', 'situation', 'properly', 'good', 'pre', 'sickness', 'would', 'rated', 'handled', 'well', 'food', 'undeniably', 'good', 'give', 'stars']"

For those of you who had read my last review on this restaurant, last time I was there, I had ordered the same thing but asked our server to substitute the rice with any kind of pasta if possible and he said yes but he didn't mention anything about the extra charge for substitution and brought me pasta with lobster in a creamy sauce and the price was almost twice as much which I noticed only when he bought us the check, from $39 jumped to $64 which I thought for a substitute, if the price is jumping that much, you MUST let the customer know in advance. Of course, $39 was the old price for this item and now I think it is $54 which is too much for what you get. My friends ordered Salmon and Branzino. She was happy with salmon, the other one with Branzino said it was just ok. for dessert, I ordered Affagato which was basically scoop of vanilla ice cream with espresso over it and a piece of biscotto. It was good if you like ice cream.  The owner also sent us Dolcetto de limone because of the last time messed up which was a nice gesture from him but unfortunately none of us liked it but if you like the lemon taste, you probably like it but non of us did. When we got the check, first we didn't notice that 22% tip was already added to our total and we  were ready to leave tips on top of that but one of our friends who checked the check noticed it was added. I could see adding the tips automatically for party of 6 and larger but I think even if you are going to add tips automatically, should be 18 to 20 % not more than that and leave it to customers if they want to tip more. Now, do I go back to this place, probably yes because of the beautiful ambiance and honestly my food was tasty but over priced for what I got.

183,2018-11-01,2023-09-17,Il Cielo,"Il Cielo is definitely one of the most beautiful and romantic restaurants I have been in LA. I had not been there for a long time but I remember it used to be one of my favorite restaurants because of the good food and also the violin player they had going to each table and play a beautiful music. So, I called the place to make the reservation and asked them if they still had the violin player, they said not any more. I decided to still make the reservation since I really liked their beautiful patio. When we arrived we were seated right away. It was a little bit cold to sit out and they offered the back patio and gave us the option to take either one. The other couple that we were meeting suggested the back patio which was as gorgeous as the front one if not more. The service was good and we got our drinks right away. My friend ordered Bucatini all' Amatriciana $26, our husbands both ordered Pappardelle al Cinghiale $28 and I ordered Burrata e Aragosta $39 which is Carnaroli Rice, Lobster, Burrata Cream.I thought well, I like the lobster and creamy sauce but not the rice so I asked our waiter if I could substitute any kind of pasta for the rice. He said yes, I could get it with Pappardelle, lobster and truffle sauce. I said ok any kind of pasta is fine as long as I am still getting the lobster with white creamy sauce. We got our foods and they were all good. Mine was in a very rich creamy sauce which was little bit too heavy on my stomach but I should admit that it was one of the most delicious dish I have ever had. When we got the bill, we noticed that one of the items were $64 which was more than any thing we saw on the menu and none of us ordered something for $64. We thought that must be a mistake and when we asked our waiter he said that was for my food. That was the only reason that I gave it 4 stars. I didn't think for substituting rice with pasta the price of my food jumps from $39 to $64 and I think we should have been told about such a big price change by our waiter. Later on I called the restaurant and told the manager that in other restaurants when you substitute something they will let you know right away even if the difference is couple of dollars so don't you think when the price changes to twice as much you should definitely let the customer know? He explained that this was a different dish than the other one because had more lobster with truffle sauce ( I just asked for a substitute not a different dish) but he also agreed that we had to be told about the big price change. He was very nice and understanding and said next time you are here you will have your drinks and couple of desserts on the house. I thought that was fair and good customer service and I am definitely going back since I love the ambiance but I will be very careful with my substitutes. Lol....

I was getting the #19, and I was going to enjoy it before my long drive back home lol.I drove down and parked in the lot.  They give you a ticket to get validated, its one hour free parking.  I walked down the block, opened the door, walked inside and told them I wanted to place a ""to go"" order.  They write down your order on a yellow piece of paper, you pay at the register ($26.00 or so), and then I took a seat.  A few minutes later, my sandwich was ready.  I took it to go, back to my car and bust it open on the trunk of my car.  How was it?#19- Sweet baby Jesus!  This sandwich lives up to the hype!  Its hot pastrami, cole slaw, swiss cheese and Russian dressing piled on their double crusted rye bread.  Man, this sandwich was bomb!  First bite in, I knew I was in the presence of greatness.  This sandwich is huge, too!  You could probably split one with a buddy, but you are also missing out on pure deliciousness if you don't eat the whole thing yourself.  The bread was warm, chewy and crunchy, the pastrami was hot and fatty and tender, the cole slaw and Russian dressing were cool and creamy, and the Swiss cheese added a little tang.  Pretty much a perfect sandwich.  I ""oooohhhh and aaaahhed"" after every bite and made my way through the whole thing. Loved every single bite.  The only thing I might do different next time is get ""light dressing"".  It was very wet in certain parts and on certain bites.  Didn't detract from the sandwich, might just be a little less messy with lighter dressing.It was a perfect sandwich to end my long weekend in LA.

A few minutes later my sandwich came out.Its a basic looking sandwich.  Meat and bread served along with some pickles.  I really enjoyed the double crust rye bread.

Easy parking nearby if you don't mind the paid lots, which we grabbed a lot off Melbourne Ave behind the 13th Church of Christ.On a hot summer day, the outside seating was still nice with a breeze. The umbrella gives you more than enough shade too.Service was fab. Real nice and checked in at appropriate times. Food came out on time too.Food we ordered:+ Oysters: Good quality, although my boyfriend felt it was a tad salty but I thought it was perfect when balanced with the sauce and lemon.+ Arancini: The truffle didn't stand out as much as I hoped, but still a really good snack with a lovely soft inside.+ Maitake: Rich and creamy in a good way. Nice mix of buffalo sauce with a side of ranch. Carrots were nicely done, with still a small bit of crunch to it.+ Gnocchi: On the richer end with the sour cream. If you want a really soft pasta, go for this one.+ Summer Arrabiata: I really liked most of this dish. Perfect pairing of squash and baby corns for texture and al dente cavatelli. Unfortunately for myself, I'm terrible with spicy food and I didn't realize this would have a kick to it. I wish the spice didn't overpower the dish as much, but some would probably like it.+ Panna cotta: We had a panna cotta with mango slices on top. I really liked this as a lighter dessert. For those of you very familiar with dim sum, this actually reminds me of Chinese mango pudding... #iykyk.On a last fun note, the bathrooms were nice in that there were two individual rooms, but my one complaint is the lighting situation. I get having a vibe and there was a dim light over the sink, but the toilet side of the room was awfully dark without any lighting. I could barely see where the toilet was and couldn't figure out the light switches as they were taped up as if I wasn't supposed to touch it. Ended up using my phone flashlight to go. Either I'm dumb and couldn't figure out the lights or they are trying to set up a very different mood that I couldn't appreciate for a simple bathroom situation.

We came here after a Kings game at the Staples Center cause we were craving some late night Korean bites.Although we didn't order an alcohol here, I could definitely see this place as a great hangout spot to pregame before going out or just in general a great space to get a bit lit! There are different rooms in this place, but they were only seating everyone in the room with the movie-theme.We ordered two plates: the chicken gizzard and the spicy intestines. Both were great however I was hoping that there would be slightly more gizzard and intestines in each dish compared to ratio of the onions, garlic, etc.I was also a bit bummed that they did not have chili paste at all. They did have sriracha and gochujang so that sufficed.Our server was nice, but at some point he started eating with his other colleague and so flagging him down for the check in the end was a bit harder.Overall, a relatively decent option in the east end of Ktown!

193,2023-08-21,2023-09-17,A Food Affair,"I was here for the first time as a celebratory dinner, bringing in my birthday! As context, I hate comparing restaurants especially when I've had authentic Parisian/French cuisine in France before, but I accidentally began comparing as soon as I saw the menu. Thankfully, the dinner did NOT disappoint.We began with some drinks and the first selection we made was ""Passionate Affair"" which was absolutely PACKED with flavor and fun bubbles. We ended up getting another because we were pleasantly surprised at how well the flavors sat on our palate. After, the appetizers made our way to the table.We decided in the Bone Marrow and Escargot. Now, honestly, this was my first time trying bone marrow and I was not a fan of the texture, however I can not comment much more on the effectiveness of the dish. There was flavor, and provided some smokiness and char-like flavor provided by the toast that accompanied the dish, but again was just not a fan of my first experience with bone marrow. Now as far as the escargot goes, I have tried them in Paris and was very anxious to taste AFA's take on the classic! Very simply, DELICIOUS. The plate is smooth on the palate, packed with a calming creamy flavor that reminded me of a flavor profile almost like a pesto, served on top of a baked potato. The serving size was also appropriate for an appetizer and did exactly what it was meant to do to warm us up for the main course. Simply could have had many more of these dishes but then... the mains came!We decided on Moms beef bourguignon and the Lamb shank tagine. Both meat selections absolutely melted in our mouths and really had their own strengths. However, we did prefer the Beef to the lamb because it had just a bit more intensity and punch that we were looking for, than the lighter, more delicate lamb with vegetables. It really just comes down to how heavy of a dish you are looking for and on another day I could see myself selecting the lamb. The pasta, made in house, was a good compliment to the beef due to its thickness and smooth contrast to a more layered protein. There was much more beef to pasta, which we had no problem with.Lastly was desert! Creme brûlée is one of those options that's simple and delicious when done right, but also has much potential to be bland, and just not up to par. It tasted exactly how you would imagine the great dessert to taste, with flavor, creaminess, and a perfectly crisped topping. No surprises, just very well executed.Overall, I have no complaints with my experience at the restaurant. Parking was accessible (a lot just behind the restaurant), there was welcoming service from the moment we walked in to the second we stepped out of the door, the environment was hip, romantic, and lended itself to conversation and liveliness, and just overall photogenic. I very much recommend this restaurant, and applaud its originality and fresh taste reminiscent of a Parisian experience right in LA's backyard!","1513 S Robertson Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90035",4.5,1564,French,$$$,positive,2957,0.171,0.049,0.78,0.9975,0.9990444578555623,0.7142857142857141,"['first', 'time', 'celebratory', 'dinner', 'bringing', 'birthday', 'context', 'hate', 'comparing', 'restaurants', 'especially', 'authentic', 'cuisine', 'france', 'accidentally', 'began', 'comparing', 'soon', 'saw', 'menu', 'thankfully', 'dinner', 'began', 'drinks', 'first', 'selection', 'made', 'passionate', 'affair', 'absolutely', 'packed', 'flavor', 'fun', 'bubbles', 'ended', 'getting', 'another', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'well', 'flavors', 'sat', 'palate', 'appetizers', 'made', 'way', 'decided', 'bone', 'marrow', 'escargot', 'honestly', 'first', 'time', 'trying', 'bone', 'marrow', 'fan', 'texture', 'however', 'comment', 'much', 'effectiveness', 'dish', 'flavor', 'provided', 'smokiness', 'flavor', 'provided', 'toast', 'accompanied', 'dish', 'fan', 'first', 'experience', 'bone', 'marrow', 'far', 'escargot', 'goes', 'tried', 'paris', 'anxious', 'taste', 'afa', 'take', 'classic', 'simply', 'delicious', 'plate', 'smooth', 'palate', 'packed', 'calming', 'creamy', 'flavor', 'reminded', 'flavor', 'profile', 'almost', 'like', 'pesto', 'served', 'top', 'baked', 'potato', 'serving', 'size', 'also', 'appropriate', 'appetizer', 'exactly', 'meant', 'warm', 'us', 'main', 'course', 'simply', 'could', 'many', 'dishes', 'mains', 'came', 'decided', 'moms', 'beef', 'bourguignon', 'lamb', 'shank', 'tagine', 'meat', 'selections', 'absolutely', 'melted', 'mouths', 'really', 'strengths', 'however', 'prefer', 'beef', 'lamb', 'bit', 'intensity', 'punch', 'looking', 'lighter', 'delicate', 'lamb', 'vegetables', 'really', 'comes', 'heavy', 'dish', 'looking', 'another', 'day', 'could', 'see', 'selecting', 'lamb', 'pasta', 'made', 'house', 'good', 'compliment', 'beef', 'due', 'thickness', 'smooth', 'contrast', 'layered', 'protein', 'much', 'beef', 'pasta', 'problem', 'desert', 'creme', 'brûlée', 'one', 'options', 'simple', 'delicious', 'done', 'right', 'also', 'much', 'potential', 'bland', 'par', 'tasted', 'exactly', 'would', 'imagine', 'great', 'dessert', 'taste', 'flavor', 'creaminess', 'perfectly', 'crisped', 'topping', 'surprises', 'well', 'complaints', 'experience', 'restaurant', 'parking', 'accessible', 'lot', 'behind', 'restaurant', 'welcoming', 'service', 'moment', 'walked', 'second', 'stepped', 'door', 'environment', 'hip', 'romantic', 'lended', 'conversation', 'liveliness', 'overall', 'photogenic', 'much', 'recommend', 'restaurant', 'applaud', 'originality', 'fresh', 'taste', 'reminiscent', 'parisian', 'experience', 'right', 'la', 'backyard']"

While the ramen is AMAZING and definitely worth coming in for, it's the bento box which immediately blew me away.I ordered for takeout and was not expecting presentation as gorgeous as what I received. Salad, karaage, sando, fruit, and pickles, all beautifully arranged inside of their box, not a shred of presentation lost in the trip back home.However, as pretty as food may be, it counts for nought if the flavor isn't there.Salad is exactly as you'd expect from a Japanese joint, what tasted like a sesame dressing on top. Light, refreshing, enjoyable start to my meal.Karaage came with a dipping cup of mayo (?), but I did not need it as the chicken on its own is beautifully marinated and flavorful. Fruit cup delivered exactly what you'd expect, fresh fruit that was perfectly arranged and served at peak flavor. Main event Katsu sando at the forefront, perfectly flavorful chicken sandwiched in between bread with cabbage and mayo; perhaps I'd go a bit easier on the mayo but the flavor is all there so I'm not complaining!Having not been a fan of pickles my whole life, I proceeded with caution as I said ""might as well try them"". What followed was the serving of pickles that single handedly made me a fan of pickled food as a whole!

The duck breast was my favorite out of the three cause of how succulent and tender it was, but everything else was very good. They have a small mocktail selection. Since I don't drink, their orange and hibiscus is a great choice.Dessert was their sticky toffee cake and i highly recommend this.

I felt that this was incredibly deceptive. Moreover, I did not even know about the fee until we got the check.

So I go to the bar to order food and I'm standing there in a great mood, chatting with the nice drag queen that was working, when suddenly I feel a hard triple slap on my shoulder. I turn around and this female bartender (found out her name is Amy) gives me the nastiest attitude and yells at me that customers are not allowed to stand there. I was shocked! I looked at her and said don't you ever put your hands on me again. Then, she replied, ""You can go see the exit!"" Wow. First of all, there would have been no issue if she kindly asked me to move. The audacity that she thought she had the right to hit me is beyond my comprehension. And then to tell me to leave instead of apologizing after? So I asked for the manager. I watched her as she went over to him, pointing at me, really just acting and looking angry and out of control. The manager came over and basically told me the same thing she did, that customers can't stand there and she was letting me know. Yes, I understand that. But can we address the fact that she was rude and placed her hands on me? He told me he didn't think she really did that! My friends were standing there watching and other customers were shocked. So not only did this uncouth bartender assault me, but the manager told me I was lying about it. What a hellhole. BTW, the manager's name I'm told is Cody.

He answered all of our questions promptly and humorously and continued to check in on us as the evening went on--making sure our water glasses were always full.The food was delicious and everyone left there full and happy to have leftovers for tomorrow. Half of our party ate family style and the other half got their own dishes. Both of which are easily doable so whatever experience you're looking for they can accommodate. i even forgot to ask for a dish to be not spicy and they immediately took it back to the kitchen and re-prepared it for me.After the meal I asked for the manager to express how wonderful our server, Matt, had done.

211,2023-08-11,2023-09-17,Hollywood Thai,"We came in here tonight after doing a photoshoot nearby - we were a party of two young women. The restaurant had an overwhelmingly unpleasant 'fishy' smell as soon as we walked in, like spoiled seafood, and the vast majority of the restaurant was empty. We were seated immediately in a booth and brought water but it took awhile to get menus and drinks. The server was friendly but he NEVER came back--- we were left on our own for SO LONG without anyone coming by to see how we were doing. He told us to use the QR code for accurate pricing since the menus they gave us were not up to date (then why give them to us at all?). I ordered fried tofu and asked for a side of peanut sauce instead of sweet chili, and my friend ordered pad see ew and some mango sticky rice for dessert. Our food took maybe 20 minutes to come out. The food was hot and fresh, the tofu perfectly crisp on the outside, but it was VERY mushy and soggy on the inside, like too much water was left in it maybe? And extremely bland, no flavor whatsoever. Even when I dipped it in the peanut sauce that just tasted like peanut butter, no seasoning or heat in the sauce at all.  It was like eating spongy cardboard with a mushy center. My friend said her food was good but honestly, we were astonished by the service. We sat down to eat at 9:15. We finished eating around 10 and waited for the server to come by to offer us to-go boxes and bring the check. We sat and talked, our plates obviously finished, no longer eating, until 10:40 when I finally flagged him over to bring us to-go boxes and the checks. He brought the to-go boxes and then vanished again. We boxed up our leftovers and waited, but no check arrived. At almost 11 he resurfaced and I flagged him down again and asked for the checks again. He said ""Oh, no one brought them to you? Sorry!"" and went to get the card machine and brought it to us. The food is a little pricey - my appetizer of fried tofu was $20 plus tip and the mandatory fee for using a debit card (we actually used Apple Pay) and while the portion size was generous I can't say the flavor or the service is going to make us come back.

212,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,ixlb DimSum Eats- Hollywood,"The reason that ixlb DimSum Eats - Hollywood does not get five stars is because they absolutely refuse to alter anything in their menu - they even refuse to cut up the Chinese sausage in the Bento Box, even though, technically, it is NOT any kind of substitution (I wanted to order the Bento Box for a person who could not eat large pieces of food, thus the request to cut up the Chinese sausage). I even spoke to the Manager, who absolutely refused. So, I ended up NOT placing a $65 order - their loss.Compare this to any other Chinese restaurant, most of which will customize their menus for the diner.We have not gone back to ixlb DimSum Eats since the infamous ""Chinese sausage"" incident. There is a really good upscale dim sum restaurant in Studio City which has a much larger selection of dim sum and is an actual restaurant, as well as a section for counter service to-go orders (that restaurant is Shanghai Rose).It is a shame about the lack of flexibility at ixlb DimSum Eats, because they have good dimsum, and I used to drive in from Monterey Park (to pick up large orders for several people) because I preferred ixlb DimSum Eats' dimsum to dimsum from various restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley (which is saying something, because the SGV is known as a great area to get Chinese food!)One thing that I loved is the turnip cake - it is very flavorful, but I suspect it might only be ordered by those people who are open to Chinese food that is not ""Americanized."" You can find turnip cakes in Chinatown in authentic dimsum restaurants.ixlb DimSum Eats is an upscale version of those authentic dimsum restaurants. The hargow and shrimp and chives dumplings are delicious. The sticky rice ball was disappointing: hard and with pieces of uncooked rice - we only ordered it once, and never again. Instead, we would order the seafood pearl, which is similar, but the rice is sticky and SOFT. The curry puffs are good, but extremely greasy. The Smiling Fish Bun is a take on Bao, in an open-faced style. It is good! But if you want just the same fried fish without the Bao and toppings, you can get the Fried Fish Fillet which has 2 pieces of fish and a side of the same sauce that is in the Smiling Fish Bun (the Smiling Fish Bun only has 1 piece of fish).Parking is horrendous around ixlb DimSum Eats. There is a very small parking lot behind the restaurant (parallel to Sunset) and very little street parking. There is an Arby's nearby with a larger parking lot, but I don't know if they will tow away cars if they see people parking there and NOT going inside Arby's. I would wait to go to ixlb DimSum Eats until after 8pm just so I could find parking.In sum, the only reason I give ixlb DimSum Eats only 3 stars is their lack of customer concern and lack of flexibility (it would have taken less than 2 minutes to cut up Chinese sausage for the Bento Box ... ).

Perhaps they could have included a bit extra sauces and condiments for the dishes (such as sweet sauce for the spring rolls), but hardly a huge complaint given how everything was.Pork Siu Mai - PACKED with meat and veg, this is perfectly seasoned and just explodes in your mouth. One order was 4 pcs and enough for a good portion of a 2 person meal. That said...I bought 2 orders for 2 people and am happy I was indulgent ;)Xio Long Bao - My comparison point in Cal is Din Tai Fung and these dumplings held up to the competition - for a fraction of the price. DTF's version has more soup and fills your mouth with hot broth immediately, while ixlb's are more subtle, but more than make up in flavor what they perhaps lack in soupy KA-POWness.Shrimp Wontons - Again 4 per order and that's plenty! Absolutely yummy, came with most crispiness remaining (not bad for a few mile trip!) and their chili sauce is solid. Seems like at least two shrimp (or a beautifully tasty and huge single) in this monster. Loved this dish.We also ordered the fried shrimp balls (odd texture at first, then that rich flavor takes over and you're transported to another, kinder, place).

Both very good.Definitely a great spot that I would love to return to and try some of the other stuff on their menu. There are a lot of desserts there that I would like to try as well.

223,2023-09-09,2023-09-17,Kuya Lord,"Really cannot say enough good things about Kuya Lord. From the food to the service to the quality to the coziness of the dining room - it's all five stars across the board from me.I'd actually never heard of this spot before heading up to the LA area for a work trip. The guy I was with, though, he not only knew about Kuya Lord but was very excited for us to try it out. Luckily, we had a couple of hours to kill between events and this place was close enough for a quick lunch.The dining room was pretty packed when we arrived, though ""pretty packed"" here means there were two larger parties already posted up at their tables. The dining area is tight, so be prepared.We decided to share a couple dishes: the Lechon Kawali rice bowl (pork belly, rice, salad, $25) and the Beef Tocino bowl (short ribs with egg, $26). We also each got a glass of their honey calamansi juice ($7 each) and - because we're crazy - decided to share the calamansi pie $(10.50).The first bites of the Lechon rice bowl instantly transported me to my youth, to being in a family kitchen with my mom and aunties, to hearing my uncles talking about the proper marinade for the beef, the best way to sear in the flavors, the perfect pairings as sides. The Tocino bowl made me pause - beef still whole on my tongue - to appreciate the complexity of the flavors and the juiciness of the meat.To say we both enjoyed the meals would be an understatement. We're still talking about the food to this day - and this was only the second meal we'd ever shared together. The power of good food, man! Building relationships and memories without even trying.The honey calamansi juice was refreshing, a bit tart and slightly sweet. The calamansi pie was...well, it was a bit much after all that food. We got through a quarter of it before having to tap, but it had a nice bite from the calamansi, and a smooth texture to the filling. I wish we could have taken it back with us, but we had several more hours in the car before we could get back to our hotel, so that wasn't an option.We both very much enjoyed our quick (though slightly expensive) meal here and acknowledge our new friendship was built over the dishes and the conversations we had while in the dining room.","5003 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.4,178,"Barbeque, Filipino, Noodles",$$,positive,2233,0.151,0.032,0.817,0.9954,0.9979883323274995,0.6428571428571429,"['really', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'kuya', 'lord', 'food', 'service', 'quality', 'coziness', 'dining', 'room', 'five', 'stars', 'across', 'board', 'actually', 'never', 'heard', 'spot', 'heading', 'la', 'area', 'work', 'trip', 'guy', 'though', 'knew', 'kuya', 'lord', 'excited', 'us', 'try', 'luckily', 'couple', 'hours', 'kill', 'events', 'place', 'close', 'enough', 'quick', 'dining', 'room', 'pretty', 'packed', 'arrived', 'though', 'pretty', 'packed', 'means', 'two', 'larger', 'parties', 'already', 'posted', 'tables', 'dining', 'area', 'tight', 'decided', 'share', 'couple', 'dishes', 'lechon', 'kawali', 'rice', 'bowl', 'pork', 'belly', 'rice', 'salad', 'beef', 'tocino', 'bowl', 'short', 'ribs', 'egg', 'also', 'got', 'glass', 'honey', 'calamansi', 'juice', 'crazy', 'decided', 'share', 'calamansi', 'pie', 'first', 'bites', 'lechon', 'rice', 'bowl', 'instantly', 'transported', 'youth', 'family', 'kitchen', 'mom', 'aunties', 'hearing', 'uncles', 'talking', 'proper', 'marinade', 'beef', 'best', 'way', 'sear', 'flavors', 'perfect', 'pairings', 'sides', 'tocino', 'bowl', 'made', 'pause', 'beef', 'still', 'whole', 'tongue', 'appreciate', 'complexity', 'flavors', 'juiciness', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'meals', 'would', 'understatement', 'still', 'talking', 'food', 'day', 'second', 'meal', 'ever', 'shared', 'together', 'power', 'good', 'food', 'man', 'building', 'relationships', 'memories', 'without', 'even', 'honey', 'calamansi', 'juice', 'refreshing', 'bit', 'tart', 'slightly', 'sweet', 'calamansi', 'pie', 'well', 'bit', 'much', 'food', 'got', 'quarter', 'tap', 'nice', 'bite', 'calamansi', 'smooth', 'texture', 'filling', 'wish', 'could', 'taken', 'back', 'us', 'several', 'hours', 'car', 'could', 'get', 'back', 'hotel', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'quick', 'though', 'slightly', 'expensive', 'meal', 'acknowledge', 'new', 'friendship', 'built', 'dishes', 'conversations', 'dining', 'room']"

Plus, I don't like bread (which is why I mainly stick to tenders), so the fact that they offer rice is a complete game changer.Fries from all three places are equally good.Other than flavor, 2 reasons why Howlin' Ray's has an advantage over the other two:1) It travels slightly better than the other two (I've dined in and ordered take out from all 3 places)2) For Angry Chickz and Dave's, if you order anything above medium or hot, the flavor significantly goes down and the spice overpowers the taste. However, with Howlin', I've ordered every spice level on the spectrum (even howlin', which put me in pain for 3.5 days), and as spicy as the food may have been,I was still always able to taste the flavor.But anyway, I'll say this.If I were doing take out, I'd choose Howlin over Angry Chickz.

225,2022-10-06,2023-09-17,Phenakite,"Phenakite has returned in a super stealth, under the radar multi course fashion inside of the Forest from the Trees art installation in East downtown Los Angeles.You are shocked when you refresh the Phenakite Tock for your daily check to see if they are back and serving and see actual reservations. You make one with no hesitation or care about the cost.The no-publicity approach seems to be destined to keep things on the DL. There appears to be a single seating for just five tables per night. It's all inclusive, food, tip and alcohol paid for when you make the reservation on Tock.The evening begins with a non-alcoholic yuzu drink while you wait for a private time in the art installation. Unusually everyone at your dinner has arrived early or on time (besides a party that no-showed, shockingly). Which left some lag in the schedule as the art installation has some time padded in. You enjoy the cool air and the opening of the exhibit where a series of microphones have been cleverly changed into small speakersThat experience is great; and interesting, however the real magic begins when you slip into a gallery esque dining room. Five tables all facing a kitchen where Chef Minh Phan works with her team composing a multi course meal. You might say it's nine or ten courses but some of the courses include multiple small dishes so you wouldn't argue if the chef told you it was a 15- or 16-course meal.Thematically the idea is tied to that of the art exhibit, indigenous foods (tho not religiously, like you might find at Owamni - The Sioux Chef, in Minneapolis), no waste, and the heartfelt imaginative cooking of the chef herself that is unlike any other in Los Angeles.Her laptop sits nearby connected with an aux cable to a speaker. It keeps turning off as the laptop goes to sleep and the chef fiddles with it to restart her playlist of 90s and 00s indie rock and alternative. Wilco and the Magnetic Fields serenade you.The walls are stark white with gallery lighting and a few branches screwed into them, but some have fallen. The wooden tables are decorated in a way that's elegant but also homey and reminiscent of how your mom or aunt might.And then the food. Bold at every step. Looking at past Phenakite menus you see some of her themes, a blowtorch (which ties wonderfully to the art exhibit) lights filled mochi and a fig leaf on fire, creating smoke and ash that drifts over the table during the course.Fauna of the forest with a flavor profile that is dreamlike. Different stems and pieces that might be thrown away used and pickled.A series of small dishes including a three sisters dish, a crab cake with the perfect season of dill and tarragon, pickles from the sea to go with it.  The lone dish of the night that fails to live up to its brothers and sisters is a shrimp with an elegant birds nest of root and tuber tempura fried on top of it. Salty and beautiful but pales compared to the flavors of everything else you are served. Perhaps that misses the point, and the salt is there to cleanse the palette.A fish dish with a medley of flavors and vegetables and perfectly splayed out fried mushrooms. The porridge course that one expects and loves from the beloved chef behind Porridge + Puffs. Two remarkable bites of venison with bright seasoning and mouthing numbing qualities.A course called a Dance Party that again minimizes the waste from the kitchen. Followed by a staple herbal granita and a crème desert.Throughout the meal alcohol pairings were served. They match the food beautifully and you make note of new wineries to check out in Santa Barbara next time .The service is warm and enthusiastic. The servers when introducing themselves reveal that they are an art student and an actress. It's at once surprising, revealing and excusing. Wines are poured occasionally with no explanation of the vintage and food dropped off without explanation, the menu is on the table so you can read, but the story is slightly lost in these moments. The lack of experience is at once endearing while also occasionally jarring given how remarkable the meal is.You embrace the at times awkward service with the same love and familiarity that the staff and space embrace you and embrace the strange situation they have found themselves in.From the entire time you felt purpose, warmth, and love poured into the meal you've been served. There isn't anything else quite like it, and you feel bad about wanting to tell people about it, as if it being secret could help it exist in its purity for a bit longer.And at the same time, you must talk and tell your friends about it, because you leave changed and touched in a way that few other meals ever accomplish.As you leave the gallery, You wave goodbye to the chef, and wish you could have this first experience all over again for the first time","1370 N St Andrews Pl Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,21,Diners,$$$$,positive,4820,0.147,0.067,0.785,0.9981,0.9993462080064373,0.6428571428571429,"['phenakite', 'returned', 'super', 'stealth', 'radar', 'multi', 'course', 'fashion', 'inside', 'forest', 'trees', 'art', 'installation', 'east', 'downtown', 'los', 'shocked', 'refresh', 'phenakite', 'tock', 'daily', 'check', 'see', 'back', 'serving', 'see', 'actual', 'reservations', 'make', 'one', 'hesitation', 'care', 'approach', 'seems', 'destined', 'keep', 'things', 'dl', 'appears', 'single', 'seating', 'five', 'tables', 'per', 'night', 'inclusive', 'food', 'tip', 'alcohol', 'paid', 'make', 'reservation', 'evening', 'begins', 'yuzu', 'drink', 'wait', 'private', 'time', 'art', 'installation', 'unusually', 'everyone', 'dinner', 'arrived', 'early', 'time', 'besides', 'party', 'shockingly', 'left', 'lag', 'schedule', 'art', 'installation', 'time', 'padded', 'enjoy', 'cool', 'air', 'opening', 'exhibit', 'series', 'microphones', 'cleverly', 'changed', 'small', 'speakersthat', 'experience', 'great', 'interesting', 'however', 'real', 'magic', 'begins', 'slip', 'gallery', 'esque', 'dining', 'room', 'five', 'tables', 'facing', 'kitchen', 'chef', 'minh', 'phan', 'works', 'team', 'composing', 'multi', 'course', 'meal', 'might', 'say', 'nine', 'ten', 'courses', 'courses', 'include', 'multiple', 'small', 'dishes', 'would', 'argue', 'chef', 'told', 'idea', 'tied', 'art', 'exhibit', 'indigenous', 'foods', 'tho', 'religiously', 'like', 'might', 'find', 'owamni', 'sioux', 'chef', 'minneapolis', 'waste', 'heartfelt', 'imaginative', 'cooking', 'chef', 'unlike', 'los', 'laptop', 'sits', 'nearby', 'connected', 'aux', 'cable', 'speaker', 'keeps', 'turning', 'laptop', 'goes', 'sleep', 'chef', 'fiddles', 'restart', 'playlist', 'indie', 'rock', 'alternative', 'wilco', 'magnetic', 'fields', 'serenade', 'walls', 'stark', 'white', 'gallery', 'lighting', 'branches', 'screwed', 'fallen', 'wooden', 'tables', 'decorated', 'way', 'elegant', 'also', 'homey', 'reminiscent', 'mom', 'aunt', 'food', 'bold', 'every', 'step', 'looking', 'past', 'phenakite', 'menus', 'see', 'themes', 'blowtorch', 'ties', 'wonderfully', 'art', 'exhibit', 'lights', 'filled', 'mochi', 'fig', 'leaf', 'fire', 'creating', 'smoke', 'ash', 'drifts', 'table', 'forest', 'flavor', 'profile', 'dreamlike', 'different', 'stems', 'pieces', 'might', 'thrown', 'away', 'used', 'series', 'small', 'dishes', 'including', 'three', 'sisters', 'dish', 'crab', 'cake', 'perfect', 'season', 'dill', 'tarragon', 'pickles', 'sea', 'go', 'lone', 'dish', 'night', 'fails', 'live', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'shrimp', 'elegant', 'birds', 'nest', 'root', 'tuber', 'tempura', 'fried', 'top', 'salty', 'beautiful', 'pales', 'compared', 'flavors', 'everything', 'else', 'served', 'perhaps', 'misses', 'point', 'salt', 'cleanse', 'fish', 'dish', 'medley', 'flavors', 'vegetables', 'perfectly', 'splayed', 'fried', 'mushrooms', 'porridge', 'course', 'one', 'expects', 'loves', 'beloved', 'chef', 'behind', 'porridge', 'puffs', 'two', 'remarkable', 'bites', 'venison', 'bright', 'seasoning', 'mouthing', 'numbing', 'course', 'called', 'dance', 'party', 'minimizes', 'waste', 'kitchen', 'followed', 'staple', 'herbal', 'granita', 'crème', 'meal', 'alcohol', 'pairings', 'served', 'match', 'food', 'beautifully', 'make', 'note', 'new', 'wineries', 'check', 'santa', 'barbara', 'next', 'time', 'service', 'warm', 'enthusiastic', 'servers', 'introducing', 'reveal', 'art', 'student', 'actress', 'surprising', 'revealing', 'excusing', 'wines', 'poured', 'occasionally', 'explanation', 'vintage', 'food', 'dropped', 'without', 'explanation', 'menu', 'table', 'read', 'story', 'slightly', 'lost', 'moments', 'lack', 'experience', 'endearing', 'also', 'occasionally', 'jarring', 'given', 'remarkable', 'meal', 'embrace', 'times', 'awkward', 'service', 'love', 'familiarity', 'staff', 'space', 'embrace', 'embrace', 'strange', 'situation', 'found', 'entire', 'time', 'felt', 'purpose', 'warmth', 'love', 'poured', 'meal', 'served', 'anything', 'else', 'quite', 'like', 'feel', 'bad', 'wanting', 'tell', 'people', 'secret', 'could', 'help', 'exist', 'purity', 'bit', 'time', 'must', 'talk', 'tell', 'friends', 'leave', 'changed', 'touched', 'way', 'meals', 'ever', 'leave', 'gallery', 'wave', 'goodbye', 'chef', 'wish', 'could', 'first', 'experience', 'first', 'time']"
225,2021-11-21,2023-09-17,Phenakite,"Had really high hopes for this place after getting LA Times restaurant of the year and a Michelin star. Overall I think the concept was cool but the execution on food and plating was lacking.First, they seat you by order of which you arrived. The weird thing is, they don't take note of who arrived first and go around asking everyone. If you plan on seating by order of arrival, then a staff member should take note to make it an easier transition to the table for the guests. Other than that, I'd say the service was solid.Some of the plating felt a bit too much, random stones on a plate or unneeded rocks. I was able to look past that but the food was just not executed well at all. There was a tempura dish that wasn't crispy, it had no crunch and felt like it was sitting in oil for way too long. The pork belly course was way over cooked. I could see each fiber and I had a tough time cutting into it. The mochi that accompanied the dish was great though. The fish dish was severely overcooked as well, I couldn't take more than a bite. At first, I thought it was just an off night but when I spoke to friends who went prior to me, they all commented similarly.

Everything felt near perfect, from the food, to the drinks, to the staff, to the ambiance and serving-ware. It's definitely a splurge meal that should be saved for a special occasion, but for me this is what all fine dining should aspire to be.THE FOOD: They only offer a nine-course set meal. It was a tremendous progression of tastes, flavors and stories that are meant to be a journey through the land, sea, and air. Some items didn't entirely hit, but overall it was a near impeccable journey. One of my few complaints is that they serve a lot of food, but don't let guests take leftovers home...so bring your appetite!THE DRINKS: We shared a beverage paring and it was a great match to the meal and felt like a perfect amount of drinks.THE SPACE: The team somehow transforms the courtyard of a coworking space into a fantastic secluded outdoor garden. It would be nice if they had heaters, but it is protected enough from the elements that it didn't get too cold.This was quite simply my favorite Los Angeles meal / dining experience over the past couple years.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!","1370 N St Andrews Pl Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,21,Diners,$$$$,positive,1205,0.227,0.015,0.758,0.9942,0.9973848320257495,0.6428571428571429,"['chef', 'minh', 'phan', 'team', 'created', 'something', 'special', 'meal', 'experience', 'everything', 'felt', 'near', 'perfect', 'food', 'drinks', 'staff', 'ambiance', 'definitely', 'splurge', 'meal', 'saved', 'special', 'occasion', 'fine', 'dining', 'aspire', 'food', 'offer', 'set', 'meal', 'tremendous', 'progression', 'tastes', 'flavors', 'stories', 'meant', 'journey', 'land', 'sea', 'air', 'items', 'entirely', 'hit', 'overall', 'near', 'impeccable', 'journey', 'one', 'complaints', 'serve', 'lot', 'food', 'let', 'guests', 'take', 'leftovers', 'home', 'bring', 'appetite', 'drinks', 'shared', 'beverage', 'paring', 'great', 'match', 'meal', 'felt', 'like', 'perfect', 'amount', 'space', 'team', 'somehow', 'transforms', 'courtyard', 'coworking', 'space', 'fantastic', 'secluded', 'outdoor', 'garden', 'would', 'nice', 'heaters', 'protected', 'enough', 'elements', 'get', 'quite', 'simply', 'favorite', 'los', 'angeles', 'meal', 'dining', 'experience', 'past', 'couple', 'recommend']"

We were a larger group, so people ordered different things and lots of appetizers, but not one of us thought our food was good. The dishes either felt over salted or bland to us.  I think we liked sides and the appetizers more than the pastas. The guy taking our order even told my friend to not order one of the pasta dishes because he didn't think it was good.Also, the wait staff didn't seem like they liked their job or maybe they were confused. I don't know if it was because we were a big ""younger"" looking group or something, but it felt like our waiter didn't want to serve our group or just didn't have good communication skills. He didn't really talk to us nicely.My friend did valet here because it was a Saturday night, and parking in this area is just terrible. After dinner, we had wandered next door to get some ice cream nearby, so my friend left his car with the valet for maybe 30 minutes after we left the restaurant, but when we returned, we didn't see the valet guy, and the wait staff told us that the valet was closed...when it was actually not. We called the number at the valet post, and nobody picked up. Luckily, the valet guy returned like 15 minutes afterwards (he was grabbing a car). I don't know why the waiter would tell us that...because not only did the waiter not help us...but he put us in unnecessary panic for a little bit.","225-227 S Garey St Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.1,178,Italian,$$$,positive,1461,0.123,0.099,0.778,0.8548,0.9272782136391068,0.4285714285714282,"['another', 'cute', 'okay', 'italian', 'spot', 'art', 'district', 'nothing', 'super', 'special', 'menu', 'larger', 'group', 'people', 'ordered', 'different', 'things', 'lots', 'appetizers', 'one', 'us', 'thought', 'food', 'good', 'dishes', 'either', 'felt', 'salted', 'bland', 'us', 'think', 'liked', 'sides', 'appetizers', 'pastas', 'guy', 'taking', 'order', 'even', 'told', 'friend', 'order', 'one', 'pasta', 'dishes', 'think', 'wait', 'staff', 'seem', 'like', 'liked', 'job', 'maybe', 'confused', 'know', 'big', 'younger', 'looking', 'group', 'something', 'felt', 'like', 'waiter', 'want', 'serve', 'group', 'good', 'communication', 'skills', 'really', 'talk', 'us', 'friend', 'valet', 'saturday', 'night', 'parking', 'area', 'terrible', 'dinner', 'wandered', 'next', 'door', 'get', 'ice', 'cream', 'nearby', 'friend', 'left', 'car', 'valet', 'maybe', 'minutes', 'left', 'restaurant', 'returned', 'see', 'valet', 'guy', 'wait', 'staff', 'told', 'us', 'valet', 'closed', 'actually', 'called', 'number', 'valet', 'post', 'nobody', 'picked', 'luckily', 'valet', 'guy', 'returned', 'like', 'minutes', 'afterwards', 'grabbing', 'car', 'know', 'waiter', 'would', 'tell', 'us', 'waiter', 'help', 'us', 'put', 'us', 'unnecessary', 'panic', 'little', 'bit']"

It started out well, good ambiance, clean, nicely lit, but our experience quickly deteriorated after.I should have known something was off when our waiter asks if there are any dietary restrictions and then says okay well I'll tell you your options later and never did. Then before he leaves the table says ""it'll be better for me if one person places the orders for everyone."" I'm sorry but 6 adults and 2 children is not a very large group. We placed our orders and waited and waited and waited. Twice they came by and said the food is coming, but never a when, or a sorry for the wait, or would you like a round of drinks for the table? We waited an hour and a half for our meals. While tables that arrived after us received their entrees.Everyone was so hungry that they ate the food that was delivered underprepared. We had raw underdone pasta dishes and my filet was completely rare and bloody when I requested medium. Now what really made the night horrible, the waiter comes to the table and says to my husband, ""I told you that it would have helped to order family style"" blaming us for the poor service. I looked at him and said that is just an excuse and putting the blame on us for ordering individual meals is poor customer service, he tried to argue back to which I said to him to just stop arguing, apologize and stop making excuses and if he could bring us the check so we can pay and leave.About 10 minutes after, a young lady comes to the table and apologizes and says she will take 10% off the bill. I said thank you we would just like to pay. When the bill came it had 10% taken off and a 20% gratuity added!!!What a terrible experience, poor service, undercooked food, lousy wait times and too expensive for this quality.

We sincerely asked her if that option can be replace with other menu since only bones are left and she said ""I can't because I already put this food (several pieces of bones) on the dinner box and that can't be replace with other menu option.""We were just appalled by her response and decided to walk out the restaurant.Isn't it common sense that if there are no meat and only bones are left, staff needs to take it off from food menu and inform customer that it's sold out and have them select different entree.If that selection was a fish entree, I bet she would give me fish bones and would tell me that she can't take it off because I chose that option and once that bones are put it into the dinner box, you can't take it off nor replace with other menu.I am just really upset how this ignorant and imprudently trained staff could treat customer with this type manner.

232,2023-09-11,2023-09-17,HATCH,"This is a nice and premium feeling yakitori place.You can find this restaurant inside of an upscale shopping mall. There are Outdoor, indoor, and bar seats, all of which you can choose from. We walked over from a close-by apartment, so I can't speak to parking or public transit, but I believe there is a subway station close-by. We visited on a Saturday evening and were able seat right away without a reservation.There were plates, sides, and raw portions of the menu, but we were there for the yakitori. There's also an interesting cocktail menu. The yakitori menu had a pretty extensive selection. I opted for the pork belly, and skirt steak & wasabi. the price difference was drastic, with pork belly being 6, vs skirt steaks 18. The latter sounded interesting and I wanted to say I at least tried it. I also ordered an IPA that I haven't heard of before.The bartender assisting us was very knowledgeable of the drinks menu and was able to help my sister in finding a drink that she might like. We also got to see him make the cocktail in front of us. The drinks didn't take too long to be ready for us. The yakitori however did take a little bit longer than we were expecting. You can see the kitchen, and it doesn't look like there are many spots to grill the skewers, so maybe that's why.The pork belly was delicious. Something about the sauce that it was covered in, really brought out the taste. I did save the more expensive skewer for last, but I ended up being a little disappointed in the skirt steak, because there wasn't as much flavor as I was expecting, given the price. Maybe it was the wasabi, as I think it is real wasabi, and not the one you would see at your everyday sushi restaurant. The wasabi didn't add much to the taste, and I like wasabi. With that being said, if I were to come back, I'd rather get 3 pork bellies as opposed to 1 skirt steak.This was a really nice experience.

232,2023-08-31,2023-09-17,HATCH,"Dope spot at The Bloc on 7th!I was there for a dinner with a friend and we were greeted by Becky who ended up being our server for the evening as well.She was super nice and helped us navigate the menu and let us know what the popular dishes were.We ended up doing the prix fixe Eggcellent Menu.I ordered a I Choose Yuzu cocktail to start the meal off and it was definitely yuzu forward...refreshing, clean and delicious.The miso corny soup came out first and it was solid. I don't necessarily judge an establishment by their miso, but if your miso isn't good...I lose hope for the rest of the food. So, this was a nice preview.The next item was the avo tuna toast which is wild caught tuna, yuzu smashed avocado, crispy rice, green onion, house togarashi. The yuzu definitely stood out, but maybe a bit much for my taste personally, but the tuna was good and the crispy rice was toasted nicely.The chicken meatball, pork skewers and the mushroom skewers came out next...loved the chicken meatball and the sauce it came with. The pork belly was good, but a bit salty and so were the mushrooms. I couldn't finish the mushrooms...Then, my personal favorite, the black chicken karaage...black because of the squid ink, cooked perfectly...crispy outside with a nice crunch, tender on the inside and that black garlic ranch...chef's kiss!There was also broccolini with fried garlic that was another favorite, and an onigiri that was meh (you can pass on this if you're ordering a la carte).The staff was attentive but not overbearing...Becky, you were amazing!Definitely check out the extensive Japanese whiskey selection and their cocktails!

Loved it so much we came back for a second round. Service was top notch - our server Manny really took care of us and made sure we were happy.

232,2023-08-14,2023-09-17,HATCH,"Came to Hatch for dinner on a Thursday! Made a reservation, but I probably would have been able to get a table without one.FLAVOR (3.5/5):1. AVO TUNA TOAST: The server recommended this one and photos of it on yelp caught my eye... but the flavor was underwhelming and tasted like something you could make at home.2. CORN TEMPURA TOWER: Good, tastes like your standard corn tempura. Not sure it makes sense for the price though.3. UNAGI: Unagi was good and tender - tbh, I prefer it on sushi rather than yakitori, but it comes with crispy rice on top for varied texture.4. PORK BELLY: The pork belly is a thicker cut and was cooked well.5. BEEF TONGUE: I've never had a thick cut of beef tongue, but was pleasantly surprised. The umami flavor was good and it was really tender.6. SKIRT STEAK & WASABI: The two skewers we got were different sizes of meat and my friend's skewer ended up tender while mine was dry. Flavor-wise, the wasabi isn't very strong and doesn't add much to the skewer. Can't really justify this for 18 dollars.7. SQUID INK KARAAGE: Previous reviews raved about this dish, but I don't see the appeal. Don't get me wrong, the chicken was tender and had a nice crispy batter, but it's nothing super special. Tastes like good chicken karaage.8. BLACK FRIED RICE: The black fried rice was probably my favorite out of everything we ordered. I liked the salty flavor profile and thought it paired well with the karaage.9. GREEN TEA HIGHBALL: I liked this drink! I mentioned I wanted something smooth and this was recommended to me by the server. Would definitely get this again.SERVICE (5/5):Service was good.AMBIENCE (5/5):Intimate and cute. Would recommend coming in on a busier day like Friday or a weekend for the atmosphere.PARKING (4/5):Garage parking and Hatch validates. We didn't stay for very long, but still had a small charge (I think one dollar).TAKEAWAYS:Hatch was good, but its yakitori is not my favorite, especially for the price point.
